Luke 1:10-20
Luke 1:26-38

1. Special Assignments
    1. When God has a very special assignment, He sends angels
        1. To tell what God wants them what to do, when to do it, how to do it
        2. God never leaves men to understand His way by themselves
    2. God sent Gabriel to
        1. Zachariah to tell of John's birth
            1. They were old and without children
            2. But, Zachariah has been praying for children
        2. Mary to tell of Jesus's birth
            1. Espoused to Joseph, but before fully married
            2. She had never been with a man - truly virgin
        3. Both were messages of a miracle
            1. They both wondered how it could be
            2. They could not believe it would reall happen
2. Special Discipline
    1. Gabriel disciplined Zachariah
        1. Abraham was told of God the very same thing
        2. But, Abraham and Sarah were much older
        3. Therefore, Zachariah had an example in Abraham and should of just accepted what Gabriel said
            1. Since he didn't, he was dumb until John was named.
            2. He should apply Bible knowledge to daily happenings.
            3. His faith and/or Bible understanding was lacking.
    2. Gabriel patiently explained to Mary
        1. There has never been nor will be a virgin birth
        2. This was very rare (one time only) 
            1. questioning doesn't show a lack of faith or Bible knowledge
            2. It is totally reasonable to not understand
        3. Even though it was prophesied, prophecy is not understood until it happens.
            - Isaiah 7:14 "Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel."
            - อิสยาห์ 7:14 "เพราะฉะนั้นองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าจะประทานหมายสำคัญเอง ดูเถิด หญิงพรหมจารีคนหนึ่งจะตั้งครรภ์ และคลอดบุตรชายคนหนึ่ง และเขาจะเรียกนามของท่านว่า อิมมานูเอล"
3. Your assignments have to be by faith
    1. If similar to Bible examples, follow it
    2. If not, then ask questions
        1. But, believe when logic fails!
