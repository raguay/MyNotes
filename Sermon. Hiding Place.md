Psalms 91

1. A passionate declaration of trusting in the Lord V. 1-2
   1. Comparing it to resting inside a fortress 
2. What others see God doing for that person V. 3-13
3. God Himself starts speaking at v. 14-16
   1. God helps because the person set his love on God
   2. He decided to love God no matter what
   3. Love always follows the one they love
