Psalms 91

1. A passionate declaration of trusting in the Lord V. 1-2
  1. Comparing it to resting inside a fortress 
  2. As long as the fortress abides, we are safe
    1. Since nothing is stronger than God, we are always safe
    2. Even when it doesn't look like we are
2. What others see God doing for that person V. 3-13
  1. Those that hunt us will not get to us 
  2. Night time fears can't harm us 
  3. Deceases aren't a threat
    1. The worse it can do is send us to heaven
    2. The ultimate sanctuary
  4. God has His angels watching over us
  5. We shall trample over all our enemies
    1. Including Satan
3. God Himself starts speaking at v. 14-16
  1. It's not about
    1. Knowing God
    2. Walking with God
    3. It's about loving God no matter what happens in our lives
      1. This is an active decision we make daily
      2. I'm going to Love God and show Him my Love
  2. God helps because the person set his love on God
    1. It's because we show Him love he will
      1. Answer us when we call
      2. Help us out of problems
      3. He will honor us in this life
      4. He will show us His salvation
  3. Love always follows the one they love
    1. If you aren't following God, your love is not much for God.
    2. Real love follows the one we love
