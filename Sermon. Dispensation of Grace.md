### Dispensation of Grace

Ephesians 3:2,7 "If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to youward:...Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."

Definition of Dispensation:
   1. exemption from a rule or usual requirement
   2. a system of order, government, or organization of a nation, community, etc., especially as existing at a particular time
   3. the action of distributing or supplying something: regulations controlling dispensation of medications.
   
1. Paul was given a **dispensation** of grace
   1. I believe the first and third definition for dispensation is in view.
      1. exception from a law
         1. Deserving judgment, we are given grace
      2. action of distributing
         1. Giving this grace to others
   2. Paul, deserving judgment, was given forgiveness by grace that he is distributing to others by God's direction
      1. It is fully a work of God in Paul's life
      2. Paul simply allows God to work through him to perform that which only God can do.
2. We have been given a **dispensation** of grace too!
   1. Deserving judgment, we have recieved forgiveness by grace
   2. God has called us to give this same grace to others
