1 Corinthians 16:9 "For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries."
1โครินธ์ 16:9 "เพราะว่าที่นี่มีประตูเปิดให้ข้าพเจ้าอย่างกว้างขวางน่าจะเกิดผล ทั้งผู้ขัดขวางก็มีเป็นอันมากด้วย"

1. Doors
    1. Opportunities to do something effective for God
    2. It is a Biblical expression of God's call to service
    3. Open means that everything is ready to proceed
        1. Paul is equipped
        2. Paul is in the right place
        3. Now is God's timing
    4. But, there are many enemies.
2. Enemies
    1. When God is going to do a work, enemies will always abound
    2. The enemies to God's work are
        1. Self
            1. We refuse to do the work by
                1. Not getting prepared
                2. Not being where God wants us to be
                3. Not listening for God to say when
                4. Letting others direct our lives instead of God
            2. Pride often causes us to mess up God's plan
                1. I want to do it my way
            3. No matter how much we get in the way
                1. God's plan will still work out.
                2. He just has to spank us into following sometimes
        2. Satan
            1. Satan uses self and others to distract, disillusion, devalue ourselves
            2. Instead of fighting or giving up, we need to resist
                - James 4:7 "Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
                - ยากอบ 4:7 "เหตุฉะนั้น ท่านทั้งหลายจงยอมน้อมกายต่อพระเจ้า จงต่อสู้กับพญามาร และมันจะหนีไปจากท่าน"
            3. Resisting is simply not giving in to the urges and telling Satan the facts that you are submitted to God and trying to do God's work. Therefore, if he has a problem with that, he needs to take it up with God.
                1. He flees because God fights for you.
                2. He is defeated already and has no defense against God
                3. But, it only works as we are submitted to God
