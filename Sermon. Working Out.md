Philippians 2:12-13

1. Salvation is a gift from God received by faith
   1. Not of works
   2. Not of merit
   3. Not of heritage
   4. We receive it only by accepting what God says
      1. We are all sinners
      2. We can't earn heaven
      3. Jesus paid the debt for us
      4. Are you willing to accept Jesus as your God
         1. He who has control of your life
2. But, once saved we are to work
   1. Our salvation has to have a result in our lives to be real.
      - James 2:26 "For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also."
      - ยากอบ 2:26 "เพราะกายที่ปราศจากจิตวิญญาณนั้นตายแล้วฉันใด ความเชื่อที่ปราศจากการประพฤติตามก็ตายแล้วด้วยฉันนั้น"
        1. If a body has no life, it produces nothing
        2. Life in a body always has an effect on this world
        3. There are by-products to everyone's life
   2. Therefore, spiritual life has to have a by-product to be real.
      1. Walking with Jesus
      2. Telling others about Jesus
3. But, the by-product is of God
   1. God gives us a will to do His will
   2. God gives the ability to perform His will
   3. We simply have to be willing
      1. Giving up our control
      2. Giving up our desires
      3. Allowing Jesus to make His desires into your desires
4. Is your salvation working in your life?
   1. What is it producing
