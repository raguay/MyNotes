John 21:15-22

1. Jesus talking with Peter
	1. Three times asks if he loves Him
		1. It kind of parallels Peter denying Jesus three times
	2. Three times Peter said that Jesus knew he did
	3. Three times:
		1. Feed my lamb 
			1. Newborn Christians
		2. Feed my sheep twice
			1. Growing Christians and Adult Christians
		3. Jesus Calls Peter to a ministry of Teaching
			1. He never studied in a school and was illiterate
				- Acts 4:13 "Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus."
				- กิจการ 4:13 "เมื่อเขาเห็นความกล้าหาญของเปโตรกับยอห์น และรู้ว่าท่านทั้งสองขาดการศึกษาและเป็นคนมีความรู้น้อยก็ประหลาดใจ แล้วสำนึกว่าคนทั้งสองเคยอยู่กับพระเยซู"
			2. But, God called and used Peter to teach others to follow after Christ
2. Peter's distraction
	1. What about the other disciple - John
		1. Everyone knew John was really close to Jesus
		2. Peter wanted to know what John will do for Jesus
	2. Jesus just said to Peter
		1. It's not about John, it's about you
		2. Follow me
			1. Don't worry what the others will do
			2. Don't worry if others will accept you
			3. Just do what God says.
3. Too many times we are like Peter
	1. Worrying over what others are doing
	2. Not focusing on our tasks as we should
	3. Assuming not knowing God's will as if God didn't have anything for us
