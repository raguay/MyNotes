Matthew 16:13-16 - Jesus asking who they think he is

1. What do others say who Jesus is?
    1. This question is asked in three of the Gospels
        1. Matthew, Mark, Luke
        2. Therefore, God is saying that this is very important
            - Matthew 18:16 "But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established."
                1. All Biblical truths are established by two or three Biblical witnesses
    2. People of the past
        1. John the Baptist
            1. Already beheaded by King Herod
        2. Elijah
            1. Never died, but taken up in a whirlwind to heaven
        3. Since they came back from the dead, there is great importance to their message
            1. God raised them to deliver the message
            2. Therefore, he is still just a delivery boy
    3. Someone promised, but not yet come
        1. The Prophet
            1. Moses said a prophet will come like him
                - Deuteronomy 18:15-19
            2. The Jews believed that the prophet would be a military leader
                1. free them from Roman rule
                2. Help them be their own boss again
    4. These are all men
        1. Prophets sent by God
        2. People that lived for God
        3. Great examples to live by
        4. But, ultimately just a man
            1. No authority to force others to obey
            2. Listen too, but don't have to take it seriously
2. Who do you say?
    1. Peter spoke up with boldness to declare his deity
        - "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
            1. Peter received from God the truth that Jesus is not just a man
            2. He is God in the flesh
            3. Since He is God, He should be followed and obeyed as God!
                1. We are His servants to do His will
                2. We should work hardest at performing His will
                3. He should lead us and direct us
3. Who do you "say" Jesus is?
    1. Not by your words, but by your actions
    2. Just a man of importance
        1. Good teaching to live by if you want
        2. But, it's just good ideas, suggestions
        3. Follow them when you feel like it, or it is convient
        4. We can question them if we don't like it
        5. But, it doesn't change your life
    3. God himself
        1. We **have** to obey
        2. Our master has said to do it, we will do it
        3. non-optional, but our way of life
        4. It should change how we live and what we do
