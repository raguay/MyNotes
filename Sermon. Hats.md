Ephesians 4:24 "And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."

เอเฟซัส 4:24 "และให้ท่านสวมมนุษย์ใหม่ซึ่งทรงสร้างขึ้นใหม่ตามแบบอย่างของพระเจ้า ในความชอบธรรมและความบริสุทธิ์ที่แท้จริง"

1. We all have many roles
	1. They coincide with our different time periods of life
		1. Student
		2. Children
		3. Grandchildren
		4. Professional worker
		5. Religious church member or worker
	2. We are used to moving from one to another like taking off a hat and putting on a hat
		1. Very automatic at times
		2. Doesn't require much concentration
			1. Except to break the mold
			2. Ex: Mom comes to school or work and we have to change modes back and forth
	3. This is the world's way of handling life
		1. Each area of life has different rules
		2. We do some things while wearing the work hat that we would not do wearing the religious hat.
2. God want us to put on the New Man above all
	1. This is our Christian identity
		1. It is put on and never taken off
		2. All other roles are under the rule of Christ
			1. What you wouldn't do with Christ you wouldn't do with the other roles as well
			2. It is the constant awareness that God sees all you do and you want to please Him
	2. But, we often treat it as all the others
		1. One at a time
		2. Different rules for different roles/hats
3. How are you wearing your hats?
