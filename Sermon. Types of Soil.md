Luke 8:5-8

1. This parable shows that people have four types of heart
    1. Foot path heart - v. 5
        1. Very hard
        2. Nothing with life lives on it
        3. They might want to look right, but they don't care for God at all.
    2. Rocky heart - v. 6
        1. Looks good and grows quickly
	        1. The roots have very little to grab onto
	        2. They don't learn to live for God
        2. But, has no endurance for problems
            1. Only wants God to give to them
            2. They aren't interested in living for Him or suffering with Him
		3. No fruit because they don't have the Holy Spirit​.
    3. Thorny heart - v. 7
        1. Caring for things of this world keeps them from following God
	        1. Sins we like to do and plan on doing
		        1. Deciding our own lives
	        2. Sins that so easily beset us
		        - Hebrews 12:1 "Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us,"
		        - ฮีบรู 12:1 "จงวิ่งแข่งด้วยความเพียรเหตุฉะนั้น ครั้นเรามีพยานหมู่ใหญ่อย่างนั้นอยู่รอบข้าง ให้เราทิ้งของหนักทุกสิ่งที่ขัดข้องอยู่ และการผิดที่เรามักง่ายกระทำนั้น และการวิ่งแข่งกันที่กำหนดไว้สำหรับเรานั้น ให้เราวิ่งด้วยความเพียรพยายาม"  
		2. They never produce much fruit
			1. Others coming to know Christ
			2. Growing closer to Christ
    4. Good heart - v. 8
        1. Follows God
	        1. A desire to walk with God daily
				1. Not wanting a life run by sin
	        2. A life lived for God's glory
        3. Lot's of fruit
	        1. When we walk with God, other see it and want to follow
	        2. Christ makes us fishers of men!
	        3. We start to look more and more like Christ​.
2. The types applied to us
	1. Two types are religious lost people or just plain lost
	    1. Foot path and Rocky heart
		    1. Most aren't really religious, they just think they are.
		    2. They might like to look the part, but not interesting in following God
		    3. God's word doesn't effect them
	2. Two types are Christians
	    1. Thorny and Good hearts
	3. But, all Christians show each type at times 
	    1. We don't always follow God as we should
	    2. We get lazy on God
	    3. We get caught up in sin so easily
3. Which type are you right now?
