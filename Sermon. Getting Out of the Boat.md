Matthew 14:22-33

1. Before getting into the boat
   1. Jesus performed the miracle of feeding the 5,000 v. 15-24
      1. Litterally created more food out of a small meal
      2. That means, he created matter from nothing
      3. Only God can do that
   2. Jesus went to pray on the mountain while the disciples got into a boat
      1. Why did they not think it strange they were going and Jesus wasn't
      2. No one seemed to wonder how would Jesus catch up with them
2. In the boat
   1. These are highly trained, experienced sailors
      1. They can really handle boats
   2. But, they could not get the boat to proceed
      1. They were litterally stuck half way across
      2. They couldn't proceed any further because all their energy was being used to stay in one place!
3. Then the surprise, Jesus walking on the water!
   1. This was a bad storm
      1. It's not a calm lake, but a raging sea
      2. But, Jesus was calmly walking across
      3. It's like the water was still for each of Jesus' feet, but raging everywhere else
   2. Peter asks to be with Jesus
      1. He always wants to be around Jesus
      2. If Jesus could do it, why not him!
      3. Really, he loved seeing Jesus doing miracles.
   3. But, because Peter kept looking around and not focusing on Jesus
      1. He sunk!
      2. He cried out to Jesus to save him and He did!
      3. Jesus brought Peter back to the boat
         1. It wasn't their work, Jesus did it all
4. How about us
   1. The boat is our work for Christ
      1. He got us into it and started us on the way
      2. But, we end up taking things our way and loose sight of Jesus
         1. Then the problems get really bad
      3. Jesus comes by and shows us the right way
         1. But, we often have to "get out" of what we are comfortable
         2. We have to start walking closer to God
         3. He gets us out of the storm and back to the work "boat"
