Ecclesiastes 5:1-7

1. When you go to God's house (church)
	1. Do not be like the lost (sacrifice of fools)
		1. They do not understand their sin
		2. They confess sin without ever thinking of getting rid of sin
		3. Contemplating sin in the future is sin
	2. Listen to God's word 
		1. With a determination to follow it
		2. When you confess sin, forsake it forever as well!
	3. Because God is in heaven, you on the earth
		1. Picture an enemy attacking God
		2. One who attacks from a higher position will win
		3. God is in heaven, can't get any higher
			1. Therefore, you will loose!
	4. Speak few words
		1. Carefully think about what you are going to say
		2. Speaking without thinking leads only to sin and foolishness
		3. Tell God you will do something and do it
			1. By saying you are a Christian
				1. you are saying you will serve God
			2. You vow to serve, you must serve
			3. Self will is never serving God
	5. God destroys the work of your hands if you do not fulfill you vows
