1 Corinthians 8:7-13 

1. Meats Sacrificed to Idols
	1. A very common practice by lost people in other religions
		1. In Corinth, the best restraints were next to the temple to their gods
	2. After devoting the meat to the idol, they cooked it and served it in this restaurant
		1. Everyone knew the meat was first given to an idol
	3. Everyone at Corinth used to do it
		1. The new Christians used to eat at that restaurant a lot
	4. When they see meat that was offered in that way
		1. They think to when they did it 
		2. Makes them feel like they are doing it
	5. It is then a trap to them to sin
		- Romans 14:23 "And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
		- โรม 14:23 "แต่ผู้ที่ยังสงสัยอยู่นั้น ถ้าเขากินก็จะถูกลงพระอาชญา เพราะเขามิได้กินด้วยความเชื่อ ทั้งนี้เพราะการกระทำใดๆก็ตามที่มิได้กระทำด้วยความเชื่อก็เป็นบาปทั้งสิ้น"
2. People have baggage from other religions
	1. Things they did in worship to other gods
	2. They know they shouldn't do them
		1. But find the old habits come back to their memory
	3. When one that is weak sees someone else do it
		1. They then think that they should as well
			1. Some Christians that are strong in faith have no issue eating the meat
			2. But, their strength causes other to sin
		2. But when they do, they still think of the idol
			1. It is then sin because they aren't eating by faith
3. I learned to worship trees
	1. My family would pray at the manger scene under the Christmas tree
		1. I have always associated worshiping God to the tree
		2. We bowed before it and it left a lasting impression
		3. To this day, I do not like Christmas trees
		4. It is my weakness
	2. But, seeing others do it doesn't tempt me to do it anymore
		1. I'm now strong in faith
4. Are the things you doing causing other Christians to stumble?
