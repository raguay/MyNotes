Colossians 3:1-4

1. We are dead - v. 3
	1. Not literally dead
		1. I'm breathing and living
		2. I'm functioning just like everyone else
	2. It is not following our own wills, but Jesus'
		- Galatians 2:20 "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
			1. A decision everyday to live as Jesus would have me to live
			2. Not doing my own pleasures, but doing what pleases Jesus
			3. Fully done by love, not necessity
	3. This should be the way all Christians live
2. By setting our sights on things above - v. 1
	1. In order to keep our focus on Jesus and Heaven
		1. We remember that we are to live for Him
		2. Jesus isn't going to wack us each time we don't
			1. But we should willingly look to him because of Love!
	2. We shouldn't focus on the things of the earth - v. 2
		1. They just distract us from the true goal
