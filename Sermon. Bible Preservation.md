Jeremiah 36

1. God has Jeremiah (เยเรมีย์) write every sermon down in a scroll
    1. Chapters 1-35 of Jeremiah
        1. Jeremiah was in prison and couldn't leave
    2. Jeremiah spake the words as God gave them to him again
    3. Baruch (บารุค), his assistant, wrote down the words
        1. Possibly Jeremiah was illiterate
2. Then Baruch read
    1. To the people
    2. To the rulers and king
3. The king destroyed it
    1. Cut it up into pieces
    2. Threw it all into the fire
    3. Made sure none of it survived
4. God told Jeremiah what the king did
    1. Had Jeremiah write it all down again
    2. Jeremiah spoke the EXACT same words and Baruch wrote them!
5. God is always preserving what He wrote
    1. It wasn't a second pass to get things right
    2. It was the exact same words perfectly preserved
    3. That is what God is doing now
        1. Usually in the main trade language of the times
        2. Now, it's English
        3. Thought, we still have copies of the original Kenoi Greek and Old Hebrew
            1. Old Hebrew doesn't use vowels, just constants
            2. But, it had a mathematically error correction system
            3. Therefore, we know it right, but not the exact sounding of it.
            4. The Old Hebrew word meanings weren't vowel specific
