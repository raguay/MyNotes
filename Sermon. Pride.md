Proverbs 8:13: 'The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.'

Proverbs 16:18: 'Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.'

1. God hates pride
   1. He equates it to an evil way
   2. It is characteristic of one that doesn't depend upon the Lord
      1. They are depending on their
         1. abilities
         2. privious actions
      2. God want us dependent upon Him
         1. Trusting God for what we do
         2. Looking to God's resources
   3. It is an attitude of contempt to what God wants to give us
      1. snubing God's supply was beneath us
2. We display pride by
   1. If we are self sufficient
      1. We believe we are able to stand on our own
      2. We are heading for a fall!
         1 Corinthians 10:12: 'Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.'
   2. If we do not agree with God's plan
      1. It is pride that makes us not like what God allows in our lives
      2. It is a defiance of God's right to control our lives
   3. Unwillingness to ask God to show us our own evil
      1. God says our thoughts are continually evil 
         Jeremiah 17:9: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?'
      2. Therefore, we should continually ask God what evil is in us
         Psalms 139:23-24 "Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts: And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting."
      3. To say that we have done that already is to ignore what God says about our hearts.
   4. Unforgiveness
      1. God has forgiven them in Jesus
      2. We too should instantly forgive
      3. To not forgive is to say God is unjust
         1. He forgave you, why not them?
3. Are we characterized by pride
   1. Confess the sin
   2. Memorize verses about pride and meditate on them
   3. Ask God to remove these "high thoughts" from us
