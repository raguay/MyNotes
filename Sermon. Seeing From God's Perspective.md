Matthew 16:22-23

1. Peter was a snare of the devil to Jesus
    1. When Jesus told of his death
    2. Peter said, no way
        1. Just a minute before he declared that Jesus was the Son of God
        2. Jesus said he spoke that of the Father
        3. Now, Peter is a snare of Satan
    3. Peter was a snare because he forwarded man's view on life
        1. Don't let yourself be killed
        2. You have all power, prevent this
        3. Peter, like all Jews, felt they would get to heaven based on Abraham's decedents
    4. But God's view was
        1. All mankind needed to be saved
        2. Only He could die for all mankind
            1. His blood alone can forgive and cleans sin
        3. Third day, He would rise again
        4. Therefore, death now led to many people able to go to heaven
2. Our problem is looking at life from a man's perspective 
    1. We are on the ground level of life
        1. We can't see ahead/future
        2. We can't clearly see what was behind/past
        3. The present keeps us from seeing past and future just like a tall buildings block our view
    2. the "here and now"
        1. of safety
        2. of pleasure
    3. Not seeing the eternal goals
        1. Heavenly rewards
        2. Life with God
        3. People in Heaven
3. But, by looking from God's perspective
    1. God is above all time and space
        1. He sees everything clearly even when we can't
        2. The present "buildings" don't block His view
    2. We can trust in His leading and provisioning
        1. He promises to always be with us
        2. He will help us to see it His way if we ask
    3. As Psalm 86 says, we need God to teach us how to view things from His perspective
        - Psalms 86:11-13
4. Therefore, identify those things in life that make you think from a here and now perspective.
    1. Remove them or do not listen to them
    2. Memorize and quote this verse will help
    3. Look to God to teach us His ways
