Introduce yourself 

After video…

This video was made two years ago. Since then, God has been blessing!

24 people have been saved since January! Also we have had many good opportunities to witness to people.

A few weeks ago while Kristi was teaching English to children, one of the dads began asking me questions about God. His brother had died in an accident. Before that he was Buddhist, but losing his brother caused him to be bitter, and to quit believing in any religion. But after meeting us and learning about us losing two children in a car accident, he wondered how we could keep following God and how we could still be happy. This caused him to want to know about Jesus! God really does work all things together for good! Please pray for him to get saved.

Please pray for more Thai Christians to want to help in the ministry. Pray for us to win more souls and to be able to start another church in another area.
