Philippians 2:4 "Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others."

ฟีลิปปี 2:4 "อย่าให้ต่างคนต่างเห็นแก่ประโยชน์ของตนฝ่ายเดียว แต่จงเห็นแก่ประโยชน์ของคนอื่นๆด้วย"

1. The world wants us to lookout for self
    1. Take care of yourself first, then look to help someone else
        1. It's not always wrong
            1. Like on an airplane when cabin looses pressure
        2. It can be a tricky idea.
    2. But, most end up just looking out for self and never help others
        1. Too busy to think about others
        2. Working for the family, but neglecting to spend the proper time with them
    3. It is a philosophy of being selfish
        1. All selfishness leads to sin
            1. Satan said "I will" - the root of selfishness
2. God has a different idea
    1. As we are taking care of our things
    2. Look how to help others too.
    3. It's a process we do at the same time.
        1. Sometimes our own needs first
        2. Other times, others first depending on the situation
        3. But, all the time keeping others in our thoughts
            1. It enables us to see what they might need
            2. We will be able to reprioritize to help
3. Be careful, we trick ourselves
    1. What we are doing for self is for others, but it isn't.
        1. Because we aren't even thinking of others while simply doing our own thing.
    2. We are easily pull away from helping others.
