Matthew 7:13-14
Luke 13:24 "Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able."
ลูกา 13:24 "จงเพียรเข้าไปทางประตูคับแคบ เพราะเราบอกท่านทั้งหลายว่า คนเป็นอันมากจะพยายามเข้าไป แต่จะเข้าไม่ได้"

1. There are two paths people can take
	1. A large (กว้าง) path and gate
		1. This is the path of self-will, self-help, and sinful life without God in it
			1. Many still go to church, read the Bible, pray, and tithe on the path
			2. But, they are mostly following the world
				1. Even the world would say you need "religion", just don't take it too far!
		2. Many people will go this way
			1. Most of the world
		3. The end of this path is total destruction
			1. Eternity in the Lake of Fire
	2. A narrow (แคบ) path and gate
		1. This is the path of walking with the Lord
			1. Jesus is our shepherd that leads us
			2. We acknowledge that His is the only and only God that created us to serve Him
		2. It is the path few people will take
		3. The end is eternity with Jesus in heaven 
2. Everyone has to choose
	1. No one forces anyone to go to one or the other way
	2. Apathy and follow friends will always lead to the large way
	3. It takes a firm decision to follow Jesus
