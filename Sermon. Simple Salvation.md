1.  Heaven and Hell are real places.

John 14:2-3  My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am.

Revelation 20:15  And if anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

Revelation 21:8 "But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death."

This is important because our society has such a misconception of Heaven and Hell that children might get confused. The Bible teaches Heaven and Hell are real places where everyone will spend eternity.

2.  God doesn’t want anyone to go to Hell.

Revelation 20:10  And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.

Hell was created for the devil and his demons. God doesn’t want anyone to go to Hell. That’s why He provided a way of escape, so that no one has to go there.

3.  You can’t go to Heaven by being good.

Romans 3:23  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.

Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.

Many people have the false assumption that if they are good people, they will go to Heaven, and bad people will go to Hell. This isn’t true. Nobody is good enough for Heaven. Everyone deserves Hell.

4.  Jesus died on the cross so we can go to Heaven and escape Hell.

John 3:16-18  For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.

Children should be taught that Jesus is the only way to salvation and to Heaven. If a child has accepted Jesus as his Lord and Savior, he is saved and will go to Heaven.

5.  Getting right with God so we can go to Heaven is the most important thing in life.

Matthew 10:28  And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.

This is a great opportunity to teach about martyrs of the Faith. Teach the children that these martyrs understood that serving God and going to Heaven is more important than even living. If that’s true, then our entire lives should be spent serving God.
