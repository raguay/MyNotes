Hebrews 10:26-31

1. Willful sin
    1. This isn't unconscious sins
        1. Forgetting to pray for God's guidance throughout the day
        2. Eating before thanking God because you were very hungry
        3. Saying something bad due to not thinking about it
            1. We should always think about what we are saying before saying it!
    2. This is when we choose to do something knowing that it is a sin
        1. Purposefully not doing the Christian homework daily
        2. Choosing to lie or not say anything instead of telling the truth
        3. Willfully dressing or acting in a way to get attention from the opposite sex.
            1. Being sexy isn't culture, it's sin!
            2. Enjoying it is sin as well!
        4. Complaining over things that happen in your life
        5. Not witnessing to others of your faith in Jesus
    3. Not your culture isn't an excuse
        1. We are now God's Children and we should conform to our heavenly culture
            - John 1:12 "But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:"
            - ยอห์น 1:12 "แต่ส่วนบรรดาผู้ที่ต้อนรับพระองค์ พระองค์ทรงประทานอำนาจให้เป็นบุตรของพระเจ้า คือคนทั้งหลายที่เชื่อในพระนามของพระองค์"
2. There isn't anymore sacrifices for these sins
    1. This doesn't mean you loose your salvation
    2. When you trusted Jesus as your only God and leader of your life, you are saved forever
        1. Salvation isn't dependent upon your ability to not sin because you can't completely stop
        2. But, when you trusted Jesus, all the past sins and their judgement was erased
            1. You can't go to hell anymore
            2. You will go to heaven when this mortal body dies
            3. God will no longer mention them to you
        3. But, God then treats us like his children
            - Hebrews 12:6 "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
            - ฮีบรู 12:6 "เพราะองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าทรงตีสอนผู้ที่พระองค์ทรงรัก และเมื่อพระองค์ทรงรับผู้ใดเป็นบุตร พระองค์ก็ทรงเฆี่ยนตีผู้นั้น"
                1. We get spanked when we willfully sin
                2. God always knows when we willfully sin
                3. God never accepts excuses
3. What God feels when we willfully sin
    1. We trample the blood of Jesus and His death on the cross under our feet
    2. It is a sign of contempt (ดูถูกเหยียดหยาม) for what He has done for us
        1. In God's eyes, Christians willfully sinning is worse than those that know not God sinning.
    3. God disiplined people with death in the Old Testament and in Acts
        1. Two or three witnesses and they were stoned
        2. Excuses did not help
        3. Ignorance of the law did not help because they have heard it or could of heard it if they listened when they were suppose to!
    4. Why should we now be exempt?
        1. Only the lost are exempt from judgement in this life because they get eternity in hell when they die
        2. Christians can't go to hell, so God judges us now!
            1. There isn't a sacrifice to stop God from judging us now
            2. If you think you can willfully sin and just ask forgiveness to remove any judgement
                1. You are totally mistaken
                2. God says He will repay us for our deads
                3. He knows what you are thinking and will not remove the judgement
4. All judgements are fearful, but especially from God!
    1. God said he will judge us now - v. 30
    2. God is alive and well and quite capable to dish out the judement in your life
        1. If that doesn't but fear in your heart, nothing will
        2. It is godly fear to not want to be judged by God right now!
