Mark 2:3-11

1. A crippled man was brought to Jesus
	1. He could not walk due to his legs being "dead": unable to function normally. Most likely from a stroke.
		1. Many strokes happen due to drinking alcohol
		2. So, one day he drunk too much and caused a stroke
	2. His friends brought him to Jesus.
		1. They loved their friend and wanted to get him help
		2. They might of encouraged his drinking which led to the problem
	3. Jesus heals the man by forgiving his sins
		1. He saw that the friends really believed he could do only that which God can do
		2. Jesus heals him by first forgiving his sins and then fixing his body
			1. A fix for the body without forgiving sin just encourages him to sin more
			2. The way Jesus did it, the man knew his sins caused the problem
				1. It helped him not to do it anymore
2. Sin has a consequence
	1. death
		- Romans 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."
		- โรม 6:23 "เพราะว่าค่าจ้างของความบาปคือความตาย แต่ของประทานของพระเจ้าคือชีวิตนิรันดร์ในพระเยซูคริสต์องค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าของเรา"
			1. There is no law without a consequence for breaking it
				1. It first manifests as bodily afflictions
				2. The ultimate result is eternity in the Lake of Fire
			2. But, God wants to give us eternal life with Him
				1. By God's terms and not our own
3. The scribes thought in their hearts
		1. How can he forgive sin, only God can
				1. Which is true
						1. They refuse to believe that Jesus is God or had God's authority.
						2. They refuse to believe God will ever forgive sins
								1. They felt that you had to be self righteous before God
								2. But, they failed to understand that no man can ever be righteous before God
				2. But, many of the prophets spoke with similar authority.
						1. They should of taken it for a word from God!
						2. Instead, they already determined in their hearts to hate him.
4. Jesus asks them "Why reason ye these things in your heart?"
		1. Our heart is the source of our decisions in life
				- Proverbs 4:23 "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life."
				- สุภาษิต 4:23 "จงรักษาใจของเจ้าด้วยความระวังระไวรอบด้าน เพราะแหล่งแห่งชีวิตเริ่มต้นออกมาจากใจ"
						1. Wrong thoughts lead to sin
						2. By thinking what Jesus did was wrong, they have sinned
		2. They were passing judgment on Jesus' words before seeing if they were true.
				1. It is a condemning (ประณาม) thought process
				2. Sets the thinker as an authority over the speaker
						1. But, none of us are an authority over God
						2. God is the final authority and we should give all decisions to Him
				3. It shows that they were not willing to let Jesus speak for himself as to who he was and what he is doing.
				4. Simply looking for a reason to hate him
5. How often do we do likewise
	1. See someone in an accident and pass judgment on who was at fault
	2. Hear about a fault and assume the worse about those involved
		1. It is our sin nature to first think of evil
6. Love always thinks the best about others
	- 1 Corinthians 13:4-5 "Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
	- 1โครินธ์ 13:4-5 "ความรักนั้นก็อดทนนานและกระทำคุณให้ ความรักไม่อิจฉา ความรักไม่อวดตัว ไม่หยิ่งผยอง ไม่ทำสิ่งที่ไม่บังควร ไม่คิดเห็นแก่ตนเองฝ่ายเดียว ไม่ฉุนเฉียว ไม่ช่างจดจำความผิด"
		1. Therefore, love all those around us will help us not to think sinful thoughts about them
