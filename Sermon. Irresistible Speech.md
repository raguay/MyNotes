Acts 6:10 "And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake."

1. Stephen
    1. One of the first deacons in the church of Jerusalem
        1. They were there to help the pastor
        2. They had no authority in the church
            1. They could not decide order of service
            2. They could not use church funds without asking
            3. They just obeyed orders from the pastor
                1. As long as it is scriptural
                2. We aren't to throw out reason
    2. Faithful and full of the spirit
        - Acts 6:5 "...and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost..."
        - กิจการ 6:5 "...จึงเลือกสเทเฟน ผู้ประกอบด้วยความเชื่อและพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์ ..."

            2. He correctly used the Bible to explain salvation
        2. He memorized and quoted many verses
            1. It wasn't one book then
            2. It was many scrolls that filled a room!
        3. He then allowed God to lead his speech
            1. It was his habit in life
