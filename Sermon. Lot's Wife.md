Luke 17:32 "Remember Lot's wife."
Luke 17:33 "Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it."

ลูกา 17:32 "จงระลึกถึงภรรยาของโลทนั้นเถิด"
ลูกา 17:33 "ผู้ใดอุตส่าห์เอาชีวิตของตนรอด ผู้นั้นจะเสียชีวิต แต่ผู้ใดจะสู้เสียชีวิต ผู้นั้นจะได้ชีวิตรอด"

1. God commanded them
    1. Flee from the city that was to be destroyed
    2. Don't even look back upon it
        1. Don't think about the past
        2. Go on ahead anew without their influence
2. Lot, two daughters, and wife left Sodom
    1. They went the way the Lord told them
    2. As they neared the city of refuge, God rained fire down
    3. Lot's wife looked back
        1. God's judgment was a lack of protection
        2. God kept them all safe from the fire, but as soon as Lot's wife looked back, she lost all protection.
        3. She became a pillar of salt
            1. Our bodies are mostly salt
            2. If you remove all liquids, just salt mixture would be left
            3. All of them would be like that if God wasn't protecting them
3. Why did she look back?
    1. Curiosity about what was happening
    2. Love for the things she had there
    3. Pleasure in the things of sin
    4. Or, simply want to preserve her former life as it used to be
        1. She wanted to save that which she knew
        2. A common sediment for all of us
4. When we don't do what God asks us to do
    1. God calls us to follow Him
        1. A choice needs to be made
        2. Follow God or Self, you can't have it both
    2. Even when we choose God, we often 'look back'
        1. like Lot's wife, we loose God's protection
        2. The forces in the world will then be able to defeat us
