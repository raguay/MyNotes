1. Fasting
    1. Jesus is asked why His disciples don't fast
    2. Comparing to a wedding
        1. Do the attendants of a wedding fast?
        2. No, because it is a joyous time
    3. Most people see fasting wrongly
        1. A way to get something they want from God
        2. Forcing God to do their will
    4. Proper Fasting
        1. Mourning/Sorry over sin
        2. It is a time of personal reflection and repentance
        3. Getting yourself right with God to see His plan
2. Patching a Garment (Clothing)
    1. If you patch clothing, you can't use new cloth
        1. New cloth will shrink different than the old cloth
        2. This causes the hole to get worse
    2. You have to patch a garment with old or similar aged cloth
        1. Then when it gets wet, it will not rip the clothing more.
3. New Wine in Wine Bottle
    1. If you put new wine (grape juice) into old bottles (made with animal skin)
        1. It will cause the bottle to burst
        2. The new wine is very acidic and eats into the bottle
        3. Only a new bottle can hold it properly
    2. If the grape juice starts to ferment any
        1. The old bottle will break faster
4. Showing that you can't fix religion once it goes wrong
    1. You have to start fresh
    2. The Jewish religion couldn't be fixed
        1. The people would not accept that they are wrong
        2. Trying to change what is wrong will just cause the whole group to give up on any religion
    3. Jesus is here declaring that he is starting a new religion
        1. Christianity without trusting in self, but only in Christ
