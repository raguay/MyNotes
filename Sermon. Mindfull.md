Hebrews 11:13-16

1. Hall of Faith
	1. Hebrews 11 tells the story in short form of the great prophets in the old testament.
		1. The things they did for God.
		2. The faith they demonstrated.
		3. The steadfastness to not go back to their old habits.
	2. In order to have such faith, they had to keep their minds on God.
		1. If they thought about their prior lives and locations, they would have opened an opportunity to go back.
		2. God says that since they refuse to think that way, they were able to follow God and are in the Hall of Faith.
			1. Even though they did not obtained in this life what they wanted, they kept going.
	3. God isn't ashamed of them at all.
		1. They did what they could for God.
		2. They let God do what they could not do.
		3. Even when God didn't do it, they kept going for God.
		4. Now, God has prepared them a city
			1. Heaven
			2. New Jerusalem in the new universe
2. How is our faith?
	1. Are we constantly thinking about what we used to do?
		1. This keeps us from walking with God.
		2. We need to not think about how we used to do things, but think about what does God want us to do.
			1. "What is God's will" is our priority in life.
			2. When it isn't, we will not have this type of faith.
	2. Are we looking to what the world has?
		1. This keeps us from accepting God's help and blessings.
	3. Are we willing to accept whatever God gives us?
		1. The three Israelites didn't want to go into the furnace, but took whatever God allowed.
			1. They were blessed with Jesus walking with them.
		2. What we face might look hard, but in it is a blessing from God!
3. How do we focus on what God wants?
	1. Don't look behind
		1. Keep your focus on the future
		2. When we dwell on past mistakes, we make them again.
	2. Looking at Jesus and not things of the world
		- Hebrews 12:2 "Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God."
		- ฮีบรู 12:2 "เพราะเห็นแก่ความยินดีที่มีอยู่ตรงหน้านั้น พระองค์ได้ทรงทนเอากางเขน ทรงถือว่าความละอายไม่เป็นสิ่งสำคัญอะไร และได้เสด็จประทับเบื้องขวาพระที่นั่งของพระเจ้าแล้ว"
			1. By looking to Jesus, we think about what He wants.
			2. By looking at our past, the world, or our desires, we miss what God wants us to do.
	3. Looking to heaven
		- Colossians 3:1 "If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
		- โคโลสี 3:1 "ถ้าท่านรับการทรงชุบให้เป็นขึ้นมาด้วยกันกับพระคริสต์แล้ว ก็จงแสวงหาสิ่งซึ่งอยู่เบื้องบนในที่ซึ่งพระคริสต์ทรงประทับข้างขวาพระหัตถ์ของพระเจ้า"
			1. A Christian by nature should be looking to Jesus.
			2. Jesus is in heaven right now, so we look to heaven.
		- Colossians 3:2 "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
		- โคโลสี 3:2 "จงฝังความคิดของท่านไว้กับสิ่งทั้งหลายที่อยู่เบื้องบน ไม่ใช่กับสิ่งทั้งหลายซึ่งอยู่ที่แผ่นดินโลก"
			1. Desire to please Jesus and not self.
			2. Things of the earth only tempt us to not follow God.
			3. Things in heaven helps us to focus on God.
4. Where is your focus for life?
