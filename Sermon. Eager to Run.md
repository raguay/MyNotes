2 Samuel 18:19-23

1. Absalom rebelled against David
	1. He felt David wasn't worthy to be king
		1. He didn't care about God's plan, just his own
	2. Absalom got all of Israel to follow him
	3. David fled for his life with his household and faithful men
	4. Israel came after David and fought with David's men
		1. David asked them to spare his son, Absalom
	5. Absalom's hair got stuck in a tree and Joab (โยอาบ) killed him
	6. Joab sent Cushi to tell king David the news
	7. Ahimaaz wants to run also
		1. so much so that he begs to go tell the news
		2. Joab lets him go
2. Do we desire to tell the news like Ahimaaz? Or like Cushi?
	1. The enemy has been slain!
		1. The devil's control on our lives has been destroyed
			- Ephesians 2:15 "Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;"
			- เอเฟซัส 2:15 "และได้ทรงกำจัดการซึ่งเป็นปฏิปักษ์กันในเนื้อหนังของพระองค์ คือกฎของพระบัญญัติซึ่งให้ถือศีลต่างๆนั้น เพื่อจะกระทำให้ทั้งสองฝ่ายเป็นคนใหม่คนเดียวในพระองค์ เช่นนั้นแหละจึงทรงกระทำให้เกิดสันติสุข"
	2. But, many do not know
		1. Ahimaaz wanted to run out with the news
			1. It didn't matter that someone else is already carrying the news
			2. He wants to go as well
			3. He wouldn't let anything stop him from tell the great news
		2. Cushi ran also
			1. But, he was commanded to run with the news
			2. He didn't really push himself to get out there
			3. It was just another job to him
3. We need to strive to be like Ahimaaz!
