Exodus 33:12-23

1. Moses is on the mountain with God
	1. This is the second trip to get the second set of tablets of God's Law
	2. Israel sinned in created molten calf to worship instead of God
	3. Therefore, the theme of this prayer is
		1. Grace
		2. God not abandoning them
2. Moses is prayer about going forward with Israel
	1. Asking God to continue going with them
		1. So that everyone will see God is the God of Israel
		2. That only God of Israel is the true creator god
		3. Not for God to simply help them or send a representative with them
			1. But His actual presence to be with them
			2. A visible sign to all that God is with them
			3. Showing how God watches over them for their good
	2. God declares that He knows Moses by name
		1. This shows a more intimate knowledge
		2. Not a casual hearing about someone, but has actively observed for himself who Moses really is
	3. Show God to Moses
		1. Moses really wants to see God in his life
	4. God agrees
		1. But, no one can see His face and live
		2. Jesus hasn't paid the sin penalty yet, so seeing God directly would kill sinful man
3. All of this prayer is about the work God has called Moses to do
	1. It's not Moses' idea, but God's
	2. God is in control, but Moses is bring all his fears and doubts to God for reassurance
