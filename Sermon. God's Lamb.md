John 1:29-34

1. John declares that Jesus is the "Lamb of God"
    1. For the Jews, the Lamb is a sacrifice for sin
    1. He is declaring that Jesus will
        1. Die because of our sins
        2. Make a full atonement with God
        3. The sacrifice removes the sin from the person it is sacrificed for.
2. John says he didn't know for sure until the Holy Spirit came upon Him
    1. John had a close connection with God
    2. God told John that the sacrifice would be coming
    3. His atonement for us would allow the Holy Spirit to live with us!
3. The only one that could be that sacrifice is God Himself
