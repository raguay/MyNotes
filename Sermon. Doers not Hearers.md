James 1:22-25
1. Hearers
    1. Those that hear, but do not act upon what the hear
        1. They can't remember what they read that morning in their devotions
        2. They don't remember the last sermon at church
        3. They hear it for the moment
            1. But, they aren't trying to grasp it
            2. If they forget, oh well, it's not important to them
    2. Nothing they hear changes their lives
        1. They keep on doing the same old things regardless of 
	        1. what God's Word says
	        2. what they hear preached about God's Word
		2. They always assume it for someone else and not them
    3. God likens it to a person that looks at themselves in a mirror
        1. Forgets what they look like
            1. Was I a man or women?
            2. Was I tall or short?
            3. What clothes did I put on?
        2. Something that is totally crazy
    4. Those that hear God's word but do not take it seriously
        1. God views as crazy
2. Their works are not blessed by God - they receive nothing from God
	- James 1:6-7 "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord."
	- ยากอบ 1:6-7 "แต่จงให้ผู้นั้นทูลขอด้วยความเชื่อ อย่าหวั่นไหวเลย เพราะว่าผู้ที่หวั่นไหวก็เป็นเหมือนคลื่นในทะเลซึ่งถูกลมพัดซัดไปมา ผู้นั้นจงอย่าคิดว่าจะได้รับสิ่งใดจากองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าเลย"
3. Doers
    1. Someone that hears God's word and applies it to their life
        1. Personal devotions
        2. Sermon in a church
        3. Friends talking about the Bible
    2. They view it as a word from their main boss in life
        1. You have to take it seriously
        2. Consequences are too great
    3. God blesses their works - v. 25
        1. God will guarantee that person's works are blessed
        2. because, he will be following after God
