2 Kings 21, 2 Chronicles 33

1. Manasseh
    1. The only son of King Hezekiah
        1. He was born after God gave Hezekiah 15 more years
        2. His birth and ruin of Israel could have been avoided
    2. Was just 12 years old when he started to reign
        1. Therefore, he was born three years after Hezekiah's illness
    3. He did much evil in God's eyes
        1. Witchcraft - all types
        2. Destroyed the Temple of God
        3. Worshiped all the host of heaven and other gods
        4. Sent his children through the fire to a false god
        5. So much evil that God declares that Israel will go into captivity no matter what future kings do
    4. God judges Manasseh
        1. The Assyrians come and take him and much of Jerusalem captive
        2. They destroy much of the walls about the city
    5. Manasseh's repentance (2 Chronicles 33:12-16)
        1. He completely repented of the evil in his heart
        2. God allowed him to return to Jerusalem
        3. He removed all the alters to false gods throughout Juda and restored the temple worship
        4. He repairs all the walls and adds to them
        5. God forgives even the most vile sins when we truly repent!
    6. Died in Jerusalem
        1. He was buried in his own house
        2. Not with the other Kings of Israel
    7. His son, Amon, did as Manasseh had done at the first
        1. Totally left the Lord
        2. Destroyed all the good Manasseh had done after his repentance
            1. Most people don't remember Manasseh's repentance!
