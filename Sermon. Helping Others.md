Romans 15:1-3 "We then that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification. For even Christ pleased not himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of them that reproached thee fell on me."

โรม 15:1-3 "พวกเราที่มีความเชื่อเข้มแข็งควรจะอดทนในข้อเคร่งหยุมๆหยิมๆของคนที่อ่อนในความเชื่อ และไม่ควรกระทำสิ่งใดตามความพอใจของตัวเอง เราทุกคนจงกระทำให้เพื่อนบ้านพอใจ เพื่อนำประโยชน์และความเจริญมาให้เขา เพราะว่าพระคริสต์ก็มิได้ทรงกระทำสิ่งที่พอพระทัยพระองค์ ตามที่มีคำเขียนไว้แล้วว่า 'คำพูดเยาะเย้ยของบรรดาผู้ที่เยาะเย้ยพระองค์ ตกอยู่แก่ข้าพระองค์'"
