1. The Vineyard
   Matthew 21:33-46
   Mark 12:1-11
   1. Many teach it is about salvation like similar parables
      1. But, the differences show otherwise
      2. No parable about salvation has the people being killed
   2. The people in the vineyard were killed
      1. Iseral was destroyed by Rome AD 70
      2. All Jewish leaders were slain
   3. The vineyard given to another nation
      1. Christians
   4. Therefore, it can't be about salvation
2. New Wine, Old bottles
   Matthew 9:17
   Mark 2:22
   Luke 5:38
   1. New wine (grape juice) can't be put into old bottles
      1. too acidic
      2. Old bottles made from animal hide would burst with the acidity
      3. The new wine (grape juice) is the pure doctrine from God
         1. The original religion was pure, but deteriated with age
         2. Grape juice changes completely with age until it is alcoholic - sinful
      4. Therefore, new grape juice has to be put into new bottles
         1. You can't fix the old religion because people like the status quo
         2. You have to completely change it to fix the problems
3. Another Nation
   Romans 10:19
   Romans 11:11
   1. The new Christian nations isn't like most nations
      1. It is a spiritual nation of all true believers
      2. It resides within man's nations
   2. Our closeness to God will provoke the Jews to jealousy
      1. Our good examples will lead them to Jesus
