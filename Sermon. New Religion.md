1. The Vineyard
   - Matthew 21:33-46
   - Mark 12:1-11
     1. Many teach it is about salvation like similar parables
        1. But, the differences show otherwise
        2. No parable about salvation has the people being killed or giving what they have to another.
           1. A Christian can't lose their salvation
           2. God will not give one's salvation to another
     2. The people in the vineyard were killed
        1. Israel was destroyed by Rome AD 70
        2. All Jewish leaders were slain, and other Jews dispersed throughout the world.
     3. The vineyard given to another nation
        1. Christians are a nation in other nations
        2. Because, our King leads us like other kings do
     4. Therefore, it can't be about salvation
        1. But a prophecy about what God will do during the current church age.
2. New Wine, Old bottles
   - Matthew 9:16-17
   - Mark 2:21-22
   - Luke 5:36-38
     1. New cloth on a tear of an old fabric
        1. The new cloth will shrink when washed
        2. That will cause the tear to get worse
        3. You can only put old cloth on top of old cloth.
     2. New wine (grape juice) can't be put into old bottles
        1. too acidic
        2. Old bottles made from animal hide would burst with the acidity
        3. The new wine (grape juice) is the pure doctrine from God
           1. The original religion was pure, but deteriorated with age
           2. Grape juice changes completely with age until it is alcoholic - sinful
        4. Therefore, new grape juice has to be put into new bottles
           1. You can't fix the old religion because people like the status quo
           2. You have to completely change it to fix the problems
     3. But, to fix the problems with the old, you have to start fresh
        1. It is impossible to change what others have been doing before
        2. They always resist change and try to go back to the old ways
        3. Therefore, you can fix the old religion, you have to change it.
           1. Since the old religion was tied to a nation, you have to create the new religion to a new nation.
3. Another Nation
   - Romans 10:19
   - Romans 11:11
     1. The new Christian nation isn't like most nations
        1. It is a spiritual nation of all true believers
        2. It resides within man's nations
     2. Our closeness to God will provoke the Jews to jealousy
        1. Our good examples will lead them to Jesus
     3. The same thing leads others to know the Lord
        1. Christians walking with Jesus will
           1. Shine His light to the world
              - Matthew 5:16 "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven."
              - มัทธิว 5:16 "จงให้ความสว่างของท่านส่องไปต่อหน้าคนทั้งปวงอย่างนั้น เพื่อว่าเขาได้เห็นความดีที่ท่านทำ และจะได้สรรเสริญพระบิดาของท่านผู้ทรงอยู่ในสวรรค์ "
           2. Preserve the world from destruction by being salt
              - Matthew 5:13 "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men."
              - มัทธิว 5:13 "ท่านทั้งหลายเป็นเกลือแห่งโลก แต่ถ้าเกลือนั้นหมดรสเค็มไปแล้ว จะทำให้กลับเค็มอีกอย่างไรได้ แต่นั้นไปก็ไม่เป็นประโยชน์อะไร มีแต่จะทิ้งเสียสำหรับคนเหยียบย่ำ"
