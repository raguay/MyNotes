Romans 6:4 "Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."

1. Christ rose from the dead
    - Matthew 28:3-4 'And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.'
        1. An atonement for our sins
        2. Jesus suffered in our place to give us forgiveness of sins
2. Therefore, we have a new walk
    1. Newness of life
        1. The old life is gone
            - Romans 6:6: 'Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.'
                1. Our old life is a self directed life
                2. Being led by a sinful heart full of sinful desires
                3. Christ died to destroy the power of that old life
        2. We have a new life in Christ
            - 2 Corinthians 5:17: 'Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.'
    2. We should walk daily in that new life
	1. A life directed by Jesus through the Holy Spirit
            - Galatians 5:16: 'This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.'
        2. It is the least we should do for Jesus
            - 1 John 2:6 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
2. What is your new walk?
    1. All are called to be a witness
        - Mark 16:15: 'And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.'
    2. As we walk with Jesus, He leads us to witness
        - Matthew 4:19: 'And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.'
    3. Everyone has other jobs for Christ
        1. Just like the body has many different parts
        2. Some are pastors, teachers, missionaries, etc.
