Luke 7:41-43

1. Jesus is eating with Simon, a Pharisee
    1. A prostitute comes and cries over Jesus' feet
    2. She wipes them with her hair and anoints His feet with oil (perfume)
    3. Simon thinks in his heart
        1. If Jesus was a profit, why was He allowing this sinner to touch him
        2. All Pharisees taught and believe that you could have no contact with sinners.
    4. Jesus gives him a question:
2. Two people owed money to their Lord
    1. They owed
        1. 500 pence
            1. Impossible debt to pay off
        2. 50 pence
            1. Could be paid off in his lifetime
    2. Both of them could not currently pay it off
    3. Their master simply forgave them their debt
3. Jesus asks
    1. Which one of them loves their master the most
4. Simon answers correctly
    1. The one forgiven the most
5. Jesus compares the prostitute with Simon
    1. She loves more because her perception of sin is greater
        1. Her sin is out in the open and everyone knows
        2. She demonstrates it by kissing, cleaning, and anointing Jesus' feet
        3. Very expensive ointment was used
    2. Simon loves less due to not feeling like he sins much
        1. His sin is private and in his heart
        2. Most of them he doesn't even know is sin!
        3. Simon shows it by just giving Jesus a free meal
            1. No kiss, ointment, or anything else
