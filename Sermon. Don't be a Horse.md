Psalms 32:8-9 "I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye. Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee."

สดูดี 32:8-9 "เราจะแนะนำและสอนเจ้าถึงทางที่เจ้าควรจะเดินไป เราจะให้คำปรึกษาแก่เจ้าด้วยจับตาเจ้าอยู่ อย่าเป็นเหมือนม้าหรือล่อที่ปราศจากความเข้าใจ ซึ่งต้องติดเหล็กขวางปากและบังเหียนมิฉะนั้นมันก็จะเข้ามาหาเจ้า"

1. God wants to instruct us for the work we are to do - v.8
   1. But, He wants us to be willing to do the work, not forced as a horse.
      1. Love should be our motive, not what we get out of it.
      2. As we love God, we show it by letting God lead us.
   2. He wants to be involved in
      1. Activity
      2. How it is done
      3. Timing
2. Horses and mules - v.9
   1. They don't obey by talking to them
      1. They can be very stuborn
   2. You have to force them to do what you want them to do
      1. You have to but a piece of metal attached to a strap in their mouth
      2. When you want them to turn, you pull on the side you want to go
      3. It must be fairly painful
   3. They will never just go easily
3. Jonah is an example of God forcing us
   1. God asked Jonah to perform a simple task - Tell the Ninavites that God will judge them
      1. He knew God would be merciful if they repented
      1. So, he refused to go and was hoping for God to destroy them
   2. His refusal led God to have a fish swallow him up and spew him on the shore closest to Ninavah.
      1. It was his bit in his mouth (เหล็กขวางปาก) and a bridle (บังเหียน) to control where he goes.
4. Abraham is an example of God just directing us
   1. God told Abraham to move his family to a place they had never seen
   2. God told him that he would have a son from Sarah
   3. They obeyed and God called them righteous for following Him.
   4. Abraham's life was fairly stable and calm.
5. Are we willing to walk with God, or does God have to force us.
