1 Corinthians 14:40: 'Let all things be done decently and in order.'
1 โครินธ์ 14:40 "แต่สิ่งสารพัดซึ่งจะกระทำนั้น จงกระทำตามสมควร และให้เป็นระเบียบเรียบร้อย"

1. God, by Paul's letter, is correcting the Corinthian Church
   1. They were very disorderly in their services
      1. Many people were talking in unknown tongues at the same time
      2. Everyone said they had a prophecy from God and talking over one another
      3. People were saying that what they had to say was more important in the church
      4. Many women were interrupting the service with questions that had nothing to do with the teaching
   2. God isn't the author of confusion or disorderliness
      - 1 Corinthians 14:33 "For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints."
      - 1โครินธ์ 14:33 "เพราะว่าพระเจ้าไม่ใช่ผู้ก่อให้เกิดความสับสนวุ่นวาย แต่ทรงเป็นผู้ก่อให้เกิดสันติสุข เหมือนที่ได้เกิดขึ้นในบรรดาคริสตจักรแห่งวิสุทธิชนนั้น"
        1. If it isn't from God, then it is from Satan
        2. The confusion causes some Christians to discard all of church
2. The different sections
   1. Exhortation to preach (prophesy) - v. 1
      1. The main purpose in the church is to teach the members how to walk with Jesus daily.
      2. Love should be the motivation for what is done in church
   2. The differences between prophesy and tongues - v. 2-6
      1. Prophesy teaches the church how to follow God
      2. Unknown tongues doesn't help anyone in the church
         1. The person is just talking to God something that not even he knows.
   3. Nature agreeing to the differences - v. 7-8
      1. Every sound in nature has a meaning
      2. Even trumpets sounding tells the soldier to attack
   4. Danger of tongues - v. 9-17
      1. Non-Christians will think you are crazy
      2. The church lacks teaching and edifying
         1. The weaker ones or those suffering are not helped
   5. Paul as an example - v. 18-20
      1. He spoke in tongues more than anyone at the church
   6. Purpose of tongues - v. 21-25 - **stopped**
      1. A sign to a Jewish person that God is talking by that person
      2. Therefore, it is not done in the church but when witnessing to a Jew.
   7. How to behave it in the church - v. 26-40
      1. Paul states that the current state of the church is unrully - v. 26
      2. At most two or three people speaking in an unknown tongue and only if someone can interpret. v. 27-28
      3. Two or three people prophesying/preaching v. 29-32
      4. Both should be done one at a time and not at the same time.
      5. God never promotes confusion - v. 33
      6. Women should be quiet during the service v. 34-35
         1. Not trying to teach
         2. God doesn't allow women to teach men
            1. They can teach children or other women
      7. Let one that is walking with God certify that God is teaching this v. 36-38
         1. But if one refuses to hear this, then let them be. v. 38
         2. We are not to argue about how to run a church service.
      8. Everyone should be seeking to preach the Word - v. 39
   8. Above all, the church service should be done decently (อย่างเหมาะสม) and orderly (เป็นระเบียบ) - v. 40
