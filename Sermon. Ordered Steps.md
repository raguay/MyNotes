Psalms 37:23 "The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way."

สดุดี 37:23 "พระเยโฮวาห์ทรงนำย่างเท้าของคนดี และพระองค์ทรงพอพระทัยในทางของเขา"

1. Good Man
   1. No man is good
      Romans 3:12 "They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
      โรม 3:12 "เขาทุกคนหลงทางไปหมด เขาทั้งปวงเป็นคนไร้ค่าเหมือนกันทั้งสิ้น ไม่มีสักคนเดียวที่ทำดี ไม่มีเลย"
   2. Therefore, God is talking about a special person
      1. Total faith in the Lord Jesus
      2. He doesn't trust himself
         1. His plans
         2. His desires
         3. His goal
         4. He know all of these are tainted with sin
      3. Therefore, he is constantly relying upon the Lord Jesus
         1. for his plans, desires, and goals
         2. Jesus' will is always right
2. Then the promise
   1. God will order his steps
   2. In the context of him trying his best to follow God
      1. there are moments you just do not know God's will
      2. the rightous man keeps going know that God is directing
      3. even though we do not see God's will, He is still guiding a person that is trying their best to follow God
   3. But, this promise isn't for
      1. A christain that is still seeking their own will
      2. or, just doesn't really care for God's will
3. Which one are you?
   1. Lost person pretending to be following God
   2. So-So Christian that doesn't really care about God's will
   3. Or, a person truly seeking God's will each day!
      1. Only this person has this promise to rely upon
