Esther 4:14 "For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
เอสเธอร์ 4:14 "เพราะถ้าเธอเงียบอยู่ในเวลานี้ ความช่วยเหลือและการช่วยให้พ้นจะมาถึงพวกยิวจากที่อื่น แต่เธอและวงศ์วานบิดาของเธอจะพินาศ ที่จริงเธอมารับตำแหน่งราชินีก็เพื่อยามวิกฤตเช่นนี้ก็เป็นได้นะ ใครจะรู้"
