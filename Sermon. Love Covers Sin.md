1. Love and Hate
    1. Always polar opposites
        1. Love and Hate can never be together
        2. It's like different sides of a coin
        3. But, great love can turn into pure hate
        4. Seldomly, great hate can turn into great love
    2. We say we have a "love/hate relationship"
        1. We love some things about it/him/her
        2. Everything else we hate
        3. It ends up with us showing an attitude of hate
        4. Even one that flips back and forth mostly shows hate to the other
2. You can tell hate by the strife
    1. There is always an easy argument when you hate someone
        1. Your almost subconsciously looking for issues
        2. The thing about them that is hated is thought about often
        3. A person just hears the name of someone they hate and the thoughts of what they did come right to mind
    2. The arguments helps people to justify their hatred
        1. It's like fuel for the fire
3. Love covers sin
    1. It doesn't excuse or ignore sin
        1. True love wants to see the other person do better
        2. When you love someone, you want what's best for them
            1. Anger isn't good for anyone
    2. It easily forgives the sin
        1. Since love forgives easily, we don't think about the sin
        2. Only good thoughts for about the person and not what they do wrong
    3. If you truly love someone, you will not bring up what they have done wrong.
