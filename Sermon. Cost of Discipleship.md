Luke 14:27-33 

1. We must bear our cross and follow Him
    1. Jesus' cross was the work God had for Him
        1. redeeming mankind by dying on the cross
        2. Accepting the shame, pain, etc. of all of the sins of mankind.
    2. Likewise, God has a task for everyone
        1. We have to take His task for our lives and follow Him
            1. Even it it is embarrassing, or hard to do
            2. Ezekiel laid on his side in public and naked for a 130 days
            3. Hosea married a whore by God's direction
2. Examples
    1. Person building
        1. First looks to see if he has enough money
        2. Then builds 
            1. So that he is not shamed
    2. Kings going to war
        1. Determines if his army is able to win
            1. If not, looks for peace
    3. Both cases, looking to see if they are able to do it
3. Cost of being a disciple
    1. Forsaking all
        1. Not abandoning, but putting God before
            1. Family
            2. friends
            3. country
    2. To follow Christ
        1. Performing His will for our lives over anything else.
    3. Those are the people that get rewards
        - 1 Corinthians 3:14-15: 'If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.'
        - I Corinthians 3:14-15 "ถ้าการงานของผู้ใดที่ก่อขึ้นทนอยู่ได้ ผู้นั้นก็จะได้ค่าตอบแทน ถ้าการงานของผู้ใดถูกเผาไหม้ไป ผู้นั้นก็จะขาดค่าตอบแทนแต่ตัวเขาเองจะรอด แต่เหมือนดังรอดจากไฟ" 
            1. The works that can abide the fire are those works that God gives us to do and we do it!
            2. The ones that burn up are our own ideas and not God's
