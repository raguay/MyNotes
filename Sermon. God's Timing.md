John 11:21-22 "Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee."
ยอห์น 11:21-22 "มารธาจึงทูลพระเยซูว่า “พระองค์เจ้าข้า ถ้าพระองค์อยู่ที่นี่ น้องชายของข้าพระองค์คงไม่ตาย แต่ถึงแม้เดี๋ยวนี้ข้าพระองค์ก็ทราบว่า สิ่งใดๆที่พระองค์จะทูลขอจากพระเจ้า พระเจ้าจะทรงโปรดประทานแก่พระองค์”

1. Summary
   1. Jesus' friend, Lazarus, is sick unto death
   2. Jesus waited 2 days before starting to walk to Lazarus, Mary, and Martha's house.
      1. Jesus knew he was dead then
      2. Know one told him, he just knew because he is God.
   3. When they got there, Lazarus had been buried four days already.
      1. Therefore, it took four days of walking to get there.
      2. That isn't an easy trip.
      3. Also, if Jesus had left as soon as a person came and told him, Lazarus would of still died.
2. Martha's show of both lack of faith and faith
   1. If only Jesus had been there
      1. She knew about Jesus healing the Roman soldier's servant from a distance.
      2. She equated Jesus being there to being able to perform a miracle.
   2. She confessed that she knew God would do anything Jesus said.
      1. She knew God would hear everything Jesus asks for the Father to do and will do it.
      2. But, she still doesn't believe He is God.
   3. But, she thought that Jesus was too late now.
      1. She didn't have faith that Jesus could cause a decomposing corpse back to health and life.
         1. Dead for four days means most of the internal organs had already decomposed. The brain would be completely dissolved.
      2. She had a mental limit for God's timing to work.
         1. A common problem for us mortals
         2. We put God on a time table to full fill our prayers
            1. Sometimes, we think God is limited as us.
            2. Not an actual thought as it is a limit to our thinking.
         3. But, God never works on our schedule!
            1. He is able to do anything at anytime!
               - Isaiah 65:24: 'And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.'
               - อิสยา 65:24 "และต่อมา ก่อนที่เขาร้องเรียก เราจะตอบ ขณะที่เขายังพูดอยู่ เราจะฟัง"
3. God's timing is always perfect
   1. Here, Jesus was willing for Lazarus to die in order to show that Jesus is God through raising him from the dead.
      1. Jesus looks at eternity more than the here and now
      2. We always focus on the here and now.
   2. God's timing is always based on God's work to be done.
      1. Never on our wishes.
      2. Sometimes it's painful for us right now, but better for eternity
         1. They didn't want their brother to die
         2. But, his death and resurrection led others to faith in Jesus!
