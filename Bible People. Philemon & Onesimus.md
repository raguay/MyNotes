Philemon 1

1. Philemon is a land owner and rich
    1. He had many slaves
    2. He came to know the Lord by Paul's preaching in the city of Colossae
    3. Since Colossae is close to Ephesus
        1. Most likely heard Paul while Paul was pastoring in Ephesus for three years.
    4. He gave some of his land to build a church
    5. Some believe he was the pastor, but many others believe he just gave the land for the church and helped keep it.
2. Onesimus
    1. Was one of Philemon's slaves
    2. He ran away from Philemon
        1. A Jew sold for a slave is to work for 7 years
        2. He broke his contract of service or Philemon over kept him
        3. We really don't know why Philemon ran away
    3. He met Paul and Paul led him to the Lord
        1. It's possible that he heard about Paul when Philemon got saved
        2. Saw a change in Philemon's life
        3. Search out Paul to learn more
    4. Paul is sending him back to Philemon with this letter
        1. To get permission to work for Paul in Philemon's place
        2. A missions offering?
    5. He becomes a faithful worker helping Paul
        - Colossians 4:9 "With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here."
        - โคโลสี 4:9 "ให้โอเนสิมัส ผู้เป็นน้องชายที่รักและสัตย์ซื่อ ซึ่งเป็นคนหนึ่งในพวกท่านไปด้วย เขาทั้งสองจะเล่าให้ท่านทราบถึงเหตุการณ์ทั้งปวงที่นี่"
3. Paul demonstrated Christ like love
    1. Put anything that Onesimus owed him on Paul's account
        1. Because Paul loved him
    2. Ours sins were put onto Christ's account
        1. Because he loves us
        2. Only he could pay the price for us
