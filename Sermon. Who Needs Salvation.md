Matthew 9:10-13

1. The Pharisees could not understand
    1. If Jesus was from God, he should be holy
       1. They felt that holiness removes their need for loving others    
    2. Holy people can't just talk to an overt sinner
    3. Why would Jesus then associate with such sinners
       1. Harlots
       2. Tax collectors
       3. In Jewish society, these are the worst of the worst
2. Jesus asked them who goes to the doctor
    1. Does a perfectly healthy person need a doctor?
    2. Only someone that is sick needs a doctor
        1. They know they have a problem
        2. They know they can't fix it themselves
        3. So, the find someone that can
3. The Pharisees
    1. Never saw their need of salvation
       1. They felt they kept the law better then others
       2. And, they did, but not to God's standard
       3. They never could see their need of a saviour
          1. They were okay on their own
       4. They could not see other's needs because they can not see their own needs
          1. Therefore, no mercy
          2. Just judgement
4. Jesus, like a doctor, can see others need
    1. Someone that doesn't have a need can see the needs of others
        1. Jesus is sinless and therefore has no need to have His sins removed
        2. Therefore, Jesus sees very clearly their needs
    2. Jesus, like a doctor, shows mercy by helping those that can't help themselves
        1. Having mercy is more important than sacrifice
            1. sacrifices are for obeying the law
                1. We sacrifice for acceptance to God
                2. Christ was sacrifice in our place, so we don't need a sacrifice for sin.
                3. We give sacrifices of praise and honor to God through prayers
        2. Jesus has already obeyed and fulfilled the law for us
           - Philippians 3:9: 'And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:'
           - Philippians 3:9 'และจะได้ปรากฏอยู่ในพระองค์ ไม่มีความชอบธรรมของข้าพเจ้าเองซึ่งได้มาโดยพระราชบัญญัติ แต่มีมาโดยความเชื่อในพระคริสต์ เป็นความชอบธรรมซึ่งมาจากพระเจ้าโดยความเชื่อ'
        3. God wants us to have mercy on others more than obeying the law
            1. Because the law is built around mercy
5. Do you see your need for mercy and God's help daily?
    1. We first trust in Jesus to get to heaven
        1. Don't think being good will help you
        2. You've already done everything to be punished in Hell forever
    2. Now, we need to trust in his daily guidance
        1. Don't think that just getting to heaven is enough
        2. Trusting Jesus just to get heaven means you are still lost 
            1. You aren't willing for Jesus to be your God
