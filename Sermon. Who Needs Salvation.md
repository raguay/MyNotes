Matthew 9:12-13 "But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick. But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."

มัทธิว 9:12-13 "เมื่อพระเยซูทรงทราบดังนั้นแล้ว ก็ตรัสกับพวกเขาว่า "คนปกติไม่ต้องการหมอ แต่คนเจ็บป่วยต้องการหมอ ท่านทั้งหลายจงไปเรียนข้อนี้ให้เข้าใจที่ว่า `เราประสงค์ความเมตตา ไม่ประสงค์เครื่องสัตวบูชา' ด้วยว่าเรามิได้มาเพื่อจะเรียกคนชอบธรรม แต่มาเรียกคนบาปให้กลับใจเสียใหม่""

1. The Pharisees could not understand
   1. If Jesus was from God, he should be holy
   2. Holy people can't just talking to an overt sinner
   3. Why would Jesus then associate with such sinners
      1. Harlots
      2. tax collectorst 
      3. In Jewish society, these are the worst of the worst
2. Jesus asked them who goes to the doctor
   1. Does a perfectly healthy person need a doctor?
   2. Only someone that is sicks needs a doctor
      1. They know they have a problem
      2. They know they can't fix it themselves
      3. So, the find someone that can
3. The Pharisees
   1. Never saw their need of salvation
      1. They felt they kept the law better then others
      2. And, they did, but not to God's standard
      3. They never could see their need of a saviour
         1. They were okay on their own
      4. They could not see other's needs because they can not see it themselves
         1. Therefore, no mercy
         2. Just judgement
4. Jesus, like a doctor, can see others need
   1. Someone that doesn't have a need can see a need in others
   2. Jesus, like a doctor, shows mercy by helping those that can't help themselves
      1. Having mercy is more important than sacrifice - obeying the Law strictly
