Jonah 1:3-15

1. God calls Jonah to work
    1. Warn Nineveh of destruction
        1. Their sins are great
        2. They are about to receive judgement
    2. But, Jonah refused
        1. He went to opposite way
2. God sends a storm
    1. The sailors wake up Jonah
    2. They use the world's method of divination (ดวงชะตา)
    3. Jonah went along, trying to blend in
3. The sailors turned on Jonah
    1. They threw him in the sea
    2. They assumed he would die
        1. They didn't understand God wants to use him
        2. The world thinks God couldn't ever use him again
4. Christians are just like Jonah
    1. When they don't want to follow God
        1. They join in on the world.
    2. When God disciplines them
        1. The world will just throw you away
        2. Preserving self over a disobedient Christian
