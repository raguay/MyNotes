Proverbs 1:1-7

1. Solomon wrote the Book of Proverbs for his son
    1. To know God's wisdom and knowledge
    2. Not be led astray like Solomon was
    3. To have a better life than Solomon
2. But, we know from history that his son didn't really listen
    1. He spoke roughly to the people and they rebelled.
3. To gain wisdom
    1. Proper use of knowledge
    2. Too much knowledge without wisdom makes one proud
        - 1 Corinthians 8:1 "Now as touching things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up, but charity edifieth."
        - 1โครินธ์ 8:1 "อาหารที่ถวายแก่รูปเคารพแล้วเรื่องของที่เขาบูชาแก่รูปเคารพนั้น เราทั้งหลายทราบแล้วว่าเราทุกคนต่างก็มีความรู้ ความรู้นั้นทำให้ลำพอง แต่ความรักเสริมสร้างขึ้น"
            1. Wisdom will keep us humble and teach us to use knowledge correctly
    3. We are proven to have gained wisdom by
        1. Listening to increase learning
            1. Wisdom actually helps us to learn more
            2. Wise people listen with the intent to learn
4. Wisdom is needed to understand a Proverb
    1. Otherwise, it's just words - no value
5. All wisdom begins with the Fear of the Lord
    1. Understanding His power and might
    2. Realizing His authority and ability to exact justice
    3. Our deserving of judgement for our sins.
6. But fools will despise and reject the truth
    1. They don't want anyone telling them what to do
    2. Therefore, wisdom is far from them
