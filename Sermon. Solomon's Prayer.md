2 Chronicles 1:7-12

1. God asked Solomon what he wanted - anything
	1. Anything that Solomon asked for, God was going to give it
	2. It was a blank check to get whatever Solomon wanted
	3. What would you do?
2. Solomon's answer
	1. Wisdom to do the work God called him to do
		1. God called Solomon to be king over Israel
		2. Solomon told God he wasn't wise enough to do the job, but was willing to do it.
		3. Therefore, Solomon asked God to give him the characteristics and ability to perform the work God had called him to do.
	2. It was a very unselfish request
		1. Solomon was focused on performing the work God wanted done.
3. Because of the answer
	1. God gave him more
		1. Riches
			1. Both money (riches) and the ability to hold on to that money (wealth)
			2. Many get lot's of money, but they are still not wealthy because they don't use the money rightly
		2. Honor
			1. Both at that time period
				1. The Bible states that all came to hear the wisdom of Solomon
					- 1 Kings 4:34 "And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom."
					- 1พงศ์กษัตริย์ 4:34 "และคนมาจากชนชาติทั้งหลายเพื่อฟังสติปัญญาของซาโลมอน และมาจากบรรดากษัตริย์แห่งแผ่นดินโลก ผู้ได้ยินถึงสติปัญญาของพระองค์"
			1. And through out the future as well
				1. Every nation around the world knows about the riches of Solomon
				2. Many languages give blessings based on that
		3. More than anyone else
	2. Solomon didn't know he had it until he started working for God
		1. The two harlots and their babies.
4. Therefore, the best prayer you can make to God
	1. Asking for the characteristics and ability to do the work for God
	2. God will always answer that prayer with a yes
	3. If you aren't getting an answer, then
		1. You might not be doing what God wants you to do
		2. You might not be starting the work but waiting on God
			1. God gives as we exercise faith in doing the work
