Joshua 5:13-15; 6

1. God called Joshua to lead Israel into the Promise land
   1. Because of Moses' sin, he could not go in
2. Here, God was showing Joshua who really is to lead
   1. God is to lead the army
   2. Joshua is to follow God's leadership
   3. Just like Christians now a days.
      1. We should be followig Christ's leadership
3. Joshua did have one bad failure
   1. He failed to ask the Lord's advice with the Gibeons
      - Joshua 9:14 "And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD."
      - โยชูวา 9:14 "ฝ่ายคนเหล่านั้นก็รับเสบียงของเขาบ้าง แต่หาได้ทูลขอการแนะนำจากพระโอษฐ์ของพระเยโฮวาห์ไม่"
        1. The Gibeons (กิเบโอน) convinced that they weren't in the land
        2. But, they were just 3 days journey away
        3. They fooled Joshua by having old clothes, shoes, and food that would suggest they had traveled a great distance.
4. But, Joshua did lead Israel to win and possess the land
   1. They were able to divid all the land to Israel
   2. Some cities still existed with other inhabants
      1. That was to keep the wild animals from overtaking Israel when so much land was vacant.
      2. Israel was to destroy them as they needed the room.
         1. But, instead, Israel just lived with them. They didn't follow God's way!
         2. They should of at least led them to trust in God
            1. But, they just left them to believe whatever they wanted
            2. They were given perfect opportunity to be witness, but they never did.
5. How many bad mistakes we make could be avoided if we just asked Jesus to lead us better?
   1. And then do what He says? Not just ask!
