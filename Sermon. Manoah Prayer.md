Judges 13

1. Manoah's wife was working in the field
	1. Manoah was in the house
		1. Evidently, very lazy
		2. He had his wife do his work and hers
	2. An angel of God appeared to her
		1. She would bear a child
			1. She was barren before this
		2. She isn't to eat or drink anything from the vine
			1. Wine, grape juice, raisins, etc.
			2. Nothing unclean as well
		3. God was going to use their child to rescue Israel from their enemies
	3. She runs back home to tell her husband
2. Manoah prays
	1. God to let the man come back and explain to him what to do
		1. It was a prayer to know more fully God's will
		2. Therefore, it is the type God likes to fulfill
	2. He didn't trust his wife to know what was spoken
	3. God answered because it was His will and plan for them
		1. They weren't living a great Christian life
		2. They were both lukewarm Christians, but so was everyone else in that time period
			1. When God's people get cold on God, God sends in judgment to awaken them
3. The angel reappears to the woman
	1. Not to Manoah
		1. She must have had a closer walk with God than Manoah
		2. She must run and get him to hear what the angel had to say
	2. He repeats all that he told Manoah's wife
	3. Manoah prepares an offering to God
	4. The angel ascends to heaven with the smoke of the offering
	5. Manoah fears death for seeing God
	6. But, his wife plainly showed that they would not die
		1. God would not of received the offering if they were to die
		2. God would not be giving His promise of a child if they were to die
4. Samson was born
	1. And lived a life much like his father: lazy and self-centered
	2. But, God still used him to destroy Israel's enemies
		1. despite the way he lived his life
		2. It was a very special case, don't expect it to be repeated!
