Colossians 1:9-10: 'For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding; That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;'

1. Are we worthy?
    1. Worthy means "showing qualities consistent with our calling"
        - 1 Thessalonians 5:24: 'Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.' 
            1. God is calling us to follow Him
            2. Our willingness to follow allows God to perform it in our lives.
    2. Professionals
        1. A doctor is found worthy by working hard to help others feel better
        2. A plumber is found worthy by knowing how to make the plumbing work
        3. Each professional works at have the proper skills and training consistent with their jobs
    3. Being "Christ like" is a Christians profession
2. Jesus showed His worthiness to the Father by being obedient unto death - Picking up His cross
    - Matthew 16:24: 'Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.'
        1. Are we trying to follow His example and picking up our cross daily?
        2. Jesus' cross/job was to die in our place.
            1. We don't die, our cross is the work God has for each of us.
            2. We deny our own way in order to do God's will in our lives just like Jesus did.
        3. Everyday Jesus followed the Father all the way to the cross
	          - Philippians 2:8: 'And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.' 
                1. Jesus knew it.
                2. Jesus accepted whatever the Father wanted for Him
                3. Everyday Jesus just did the Father's will
        4. Is following Him our goal in life as it was Jesus' goal?
            1. We have to deny ourselves daily
            2. Then and only then can we follow Jesus
3. We can never be worthy of God's love or salvation
    1. It's a gift He gives us
    2. A gift can't be based on anything we do and still be a gift
4. But, His love should motivate us to live for Him 
    1. We should return His love by following Jesus
    2. But, we can't without being willing to pick up our cross!
        1. Then we will be fruitful and filled with His knowledge
