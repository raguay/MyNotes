Romans 12:2 "And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God."
โรม 12:2 "อย่าทำตามอย่างชาวโลกนี้ แต่จงรับการเปลี่ยนแปลงจิตใจเสียใหม่ เพื่อท่านจะได้ทราบพระประสงค์ของพระเจ้าว่าอะไรดี อะไรเป็นที่ชอบพระทัย และอะไรดียอดเยี่ยม"

1. God's will (พระประสงค์)
	1. This is what God, the boss, want his children to do.
	2. In the Jewish tradition, doing God's work and doing God's will is the same thing.
		1. Everything in God's will is something that God wants us to do.
		2. Therefore, it can be described a work.
	3. God’s will is not something that we can't know.
	4. God is always telling us what he wants us to do.
2. The will of God for the lost
	- John 6:29 "Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent."
	- ยอห์น 6:29 "พระเยซูตรัสตอบเขาว่า "งานของพระเจ้านั้นคือการที่ท่านเชื่อในท่านที่พระองค์ทรงใช้มานั้น""
		1. To believe on Jesus
			1. By faith that He is God
			2. He died to pay the penalty of our sins
			3. He rose again to give a new life that is able to follow God.
3. The will of God for Christians
	1. There are three areas of God's will
		1. The "good" (อะไรดี) will
		2. The "acceptable" (อะไรเป้นที่ชอบพระทัย) will
		3. The "perfect" (อะไรดียอดเยี่ยม) will
	2. Just like the illustration I like to use
		1. The house of God that has a yard and a fence that separates from the world
			1. On the fence Christians
				1. Do good enough to look like a good Christian to the world
				2. But, liking the self-will life too much.
				3. These can't hear God at all.
			2. In the yard Christians
				1. These try to cultivate a close life to God, but keep getting entangled in self-will. 
				2. The usually don't stay in the yard, but have a tendency to go back and forth a lot!
				3. They hear God when they are closest to the house or in the house for a while.
					1. But then do God's will their way.
			3. In the house with God Christians
				1. These are Christians from Matthew 5:8 
					- Matthew 5:8 "Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."
					- มัทธิว 5:8 "บุคคลผู้ใดมีใจบริสุทธิ์ ผู้นั้นเป็นสุข เพราะว่าเขาจะได้เห็นพระเจ้า"
						1. These Christians love God with all their heart.
						2. They want to follow God completely
						3. They are very honest with God and self about their sins and are constantly confessing their sins to stay close to God.
						4. When they confess the sins honestly, they have a clean heart and see God.
				2. These Christians always hear God clearly.
		2. Every Christian has moments, days, weeks, or years in each category.
			1. Our goal should be to be a in the house Christian as much as possible.
			2. It requires a life honest with God and self about our sins and our walk with God.
4. Where are you right now?
	1. You don't have to stay on the fence or in the yard.
	2. You can have that close relationship with God in God's house.
		1. You just have to be honest and confess your sins with a desire not to do them again.
		2. Then you need a heart desire to stay in God’s house.
