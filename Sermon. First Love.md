1 John 4:19 "We love him, because he first loved us."
1ยอห์น 4:19 "เราทั้งหลายรักพระองค์ ก็เพราะพระองค์ทรงรักเราก่อน"

1. Have you lost your first Love?
	- Revelation 2:4 "Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love."
	- วิวรณ์ 2:4 "แต่เรามีข้อที่จะต่อว่าเจ้าบ้าง คือว่าเจ้าละทิ้งความรักดั้งเดิมของเจ้า"
	   1. The question isn't about ever loving
	      1. but losing that which you once had
	   2. Not about false Christians
	      1. they never had it to begin with.
2. But, we love Christ because he first loved us
      1. He openly demonstrated that first love
         1. Living an example life for us
         2. Dying on the cross
         3. Going to Hell instead of us
         4. Giving us eternal life
            1. Just because we accept who he is and willing to follow after Him
            2. Not on what we do, but what we believe
      2. We also demonstrate our love to Him
         1. Denying the flesh (self will)
         2. Serving Him with our lives
         3. Working for Him because we love Him
            1. Not to get something
            2. But, because He loves us, we love Him and willingly serve Him
         4. Telling other about who we love
            1. Those that don't talk about whom they love, they don't really love
            2. Just like a married man that is flirting with another woman will not talk about the wife.
3. How does losing our first love happen
   1. Not willing to spend quality time with God
      1. Prayer
      2. Bible Study
      3. Faithful church attendance
   2. Gratifying the flesh
   3. Living for self
   4. Working for the sake of working and looking good
