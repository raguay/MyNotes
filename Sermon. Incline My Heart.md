1 Kings 8:57-58
"The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let him not leave us, nor forsake us: That he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and his statutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers."

1.  Solomon said 
	- 1 Kings 8:46a 'If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)...'
		1. Our sins keep us from walking with Jesus
		2. We have to acknowledge this daily and ask His forgiveness
		3. Then, keep asking God to incline our hearts towards him.
2. Two friends
	1. They want to go to a place and they have a map that shows two divergent ways.
	2. The map shows the best route, but at the junction that route looks hard while the other route looks easy
		1. One takes the easy looking route and never makes it to the destination
			1. His heart was inclined to take what looked easy
		2. The other followed what the map said and safely made it to the destination
			1. His heart was inclined to follow the map
	3. We have the same type of decision to make everyday
		1. Follow self or follow Jesus
		2. Unless our hearts are inclined toward Jesus, we will choose self
3. Is our heart inclined to Jesus
	1. It is the work God does in us as we try to draw nigh to Him
		- Philippians 2:13: 'For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.'
			1. God gives us the desire first
			2. We accept it as our own desire
			3. Then, God makes it happen in our lives!
	2. We need to examine ourselves that we really want to be close to Jesus
		1. Not to look good at church
		2. Truly following Him no matter what He asks of us
			1. Not just when it looks easy
			2. Accepting the hard times God allows in our lives along with the easy times
