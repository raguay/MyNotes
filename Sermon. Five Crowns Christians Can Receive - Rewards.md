Revelation 4:4 "And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold."

Revelation 4:10-11 "The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created."

1. The elders represent all redeamed
   1. 12 Tribes of Israel
   2. 12 Apostles
2. They cast to Christ crowns that they recieved in life
   1. We are rewarded at the judgment seat of Christ for our service
3. Since they are rewards, this is during 1000 year Reign of Christ
   1. No remembrance of the former life afterwards
      Revelation 21:4 "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away."
   2. In order for no more tears, we would have to forget our former failures
   3. "passed away" in the Bible often refers to no longer remembered
4. The five Crowns
   1. Crown of Life:
   
      James 1:12: 'Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.'
   
      Revelation 2:10: 'Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.'
   
      1. For preparing to serve God
   
   2. The Incorruptible Crown: 
   
      1 Corinthians 9:24-25 "Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain. And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible."
   
      1. For Walking with God
   
   3. Crown of Rejoicing:
   
      1 Thessalonians 2:19-20 "For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? For ye are our glory and joy."
   
      1. For each person lead to the Lord
   
   4. Crown of Righteousness:
   
      2 Timothy 4:8: 'Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.'
      
      1. For being ready to receive Him
   
   5. Crown of Glory:
   
      Proverbs 4:9: 'She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.'
   
      Proverbs 16:31: 'The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.'
   
      1 Peter 5:4: 'And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.'
