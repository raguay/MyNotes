James 4:17 "Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin."

ยากอบ 4:17 "เหตุฉะนั้น คนใดที่รู้จักกระทำการดี และไม่ได้กระทำ บาปจึงมีแก่คนนั้น"

Galatians 6:9 "And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."

กาลาเทีย 6:9 "อย่าให้เราเมื่อยล้าในการทำดี เพราะว่าถ้าเราไม่ท้อใจแล้ว เราก็จะเกี่ยวเก็บในเวลาอันสมควร"

1. Doing good is always right
    1. Especially, good in God's eyes
    2. What is good in our sight isn't always right
2. But, God explains that not doing what we know is right is sin!
    1. Sin implies there is a penalty
        1. Christians can't go to Hell
        2. But, we loose rewards, help in this life, God's fellowship, etc.
    2. People focus on obeying the law
        1. The restricting of our activities according to a rule
        2. This says nothing about what we know is right and not doing it.
        3. Therefore, keeping the law will produce sin if we aren't doing what we know we should be doing.
    3. A car
        1. The manual gives laws on taking care of the car
        2. I've never seen in a manual "when" to put in gas
        3. If we never put gas in - "knowing to do good" - we end up with a penalty - the car quits running.
3. God has things in His word that He will never talk to us about
    1. He already did in His word
    2. We know to do right - follow His word
    3. If we aren't doing it, we are sinning - even if we didn't know because we didn't read it!
