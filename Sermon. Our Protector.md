Psalms 121

1. David says he keeps his eye on the one that helps him.
    1. Always looking towards the Lord
        - Colossians 3:2 "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
        - โคโลสี 3:2 "จงฝังความคิดของท่านไว้กับสิ่งทั้งหลายที่อยู่เบื้องบน ไม่ใช่กับสิ่งทั้งหลายซึ่งอยู่ที่แผ่นดินโลก"
            1. You can't walk with someone that you aren't looking towards
            2. David is keeping close to the Lord by watching Him
    2. Many of David's psalms speak about God living in the hills
        1. Because they never change
        2. They point to God in heaven
        3. God always met with His people in a mountain
2. God will protect his people
    1. Foot not be moved
        1. We will not stumble walking with God
        2. We only stumble when we walk alone in self-will
    2. Shade of they right hand
        1. Right hand speaks of our strength
        2. God protects (shade protect from the sun) our strength
        3. While God is a shade to our strength, He also is our strength
    3. The sun or moon will not smite them
        1. Things in this world can't really harm us
        2. The worse the world can do is send us to heaven
        3. Figuratively
            1. Sun represents visible problems
            2. Moon represents invisible problems
    4. Preserve His people from all evil
        1. God's people walking with God are kept from evil because of the nature of the one we are following
        2. God can't sin and neither can we while we are walking with Him
    5. He will protect us while away from home
        1. We will all get home safe and sound
3. God never sleeps or slumbers
    1. Therefore, nothing catches Him by surprise
    2. He knows about everything
4. So, why worry?
