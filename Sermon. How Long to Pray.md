1. Main question for new Christians - How long to pray
   1. They might come from a stand point that prayer is just
      1. Repitition of some words
      2. Not a conversation, but a presentation of wants
      3. A practice of habit before meals
   2. Some want to make sure they don't over do it
      1. Which is silly, you can't overdo prayer
      2. Prayer is a time to talk to your best friend
   3. Some really want to know what God wants
      1. But, they want just the minimal amount of prayer
         1. They want their time for themselves
         2. So, they want just enough for God to bless
      2. Those that really seek after God love spending time with God
         1. Prayer then becomes a way of life
         2. It is a time of drawing close to God and learning from God
         3. These are the Christians that receive much from God
2. Types of prayer
   1. General prayer as we live
      - 1 Thessalonians 5:17 "Pray without ceasing."
      - 1เธสะโลนิกา 5:17 "จงอธิษฐานอย่างสม่ำเสมอ"
      - 1 Timothy 2:8 "I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
      - 1ทิโมธี 2:8 "เหตุฉะนั้น ข้าพเจ้าปรารถนาให้ผู้ชายทั้งหลายอธิษฐานในที่ทุกแห่ง โดยยกมืออันบริสุทธิ์ปราศจากโทโสและการเถียงกัน"
        1. To get God's direction in life
           1. But, this only works as they have a good dedicated prayer time
        2. Praying for people we meet or see during the day
        3. Giving to God our problems as they happen
   2. Dedicated prayer at least once a day
      - Matthew 26:40 "And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?"
      - มัทธิว 26:40 "พระองค์จึงเสด็จกลับมายังสาวกเหล่านั้น เห็นเขานอนหลับอยู่ และตรัสกับเปโตรว่า "เป็นอย่างไรนะ ท่านทั้งหลายจะคอยเฝ้าอยู่กับเราสักชั่วเวลาหนึ่งไม่ได้หรือ"
      - Ephesians 6:18 "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
      - เอเฟซัส 6:18 "จงอธิษฐานวิงวอนทุกอย่างและจงขอโดยพระวิญญาณทุกเวลา ทั้งนี้จงระวังตัวด้วยความเพียรทุกอย่าง จงอธิษฐานเพื่อวิสุทธิชนทุกคน"
        1. This is the main "business" of prayer
        2. We bring everything to God and seek His face
           1. Problems
           2. People who need salvation
           3. Overall directions of God's work
           4. Obtaining the Grace we need
        3. People only have dedicated prayer when it is a part of their normal daily habits.
           1. If they sometimes have long periods of prayer, but not always
              1. Then it's still not dedicated prayer
              2. Usually is just desperate prayer for a need.
3. Prayer of Biblical people
   1. Enoch
      1. Just a single verse that he walked with God
      2. That means he had a lot of dedicated prayer time
      3. God kept him from the flood and is a type of the rapture of the church.
   2. David
      1. The bible doesn't say how often he had dedicated prayer
      2. God does call David, a man after His heart
         1. That alone tells that David had lots of dedicated prayer time.
      3. Also, the Psalms are basically prayers
         1. Therefore, he must have had lots of dedicated prayer time
   3. Ezekiel
      1. God used mightily as to showing Israel's sins
      2. Each time God talked with Ezekiel, he was praying
         1. That was a time of dedicated prayer
         2. Therefore, he had lot's of time in dedicated prayer
   4. Daniel
      1. Prayed three times a day for one hour - Dedicated prayer!
      2. God used him greatly
4. Therefore, if you want God to use you
   1. You have to have lots of dedicated prayer time
   2. It's the only way to really know God's will for your life.
   3. Others often get confused with the Devil's will over God's will.
