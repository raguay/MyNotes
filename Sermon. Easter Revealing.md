Matthew 28 

1. The women went to the tomb
    1. They needed to prepare the body properly
        1. There just wasn't time when he died
        2. Then there were three Sabbath days
            1. Wed 6pm - Thur 6pm - Passover
            2. Thur 6pm - Fri 6pm - Second day of Passover
            3. Fri 6pm - Sat 6pm - Normal Sabboth day
    2. Outsiders had buried him
        1. They were basically, checking up on what they did
    3. It was a good excuse to see his body again.
2. The angel revealed the empty tomb
    1. He did not take the body out
    2. The body was already gone
        1. Christ arose before Sat 6:00pm - the beginning of the Fourth
    3. The angel just made it possible for everyone to see
        1. It got rid of the guards too.
3. Christ reveal His plan for the church
    1. Tell everyone about His resurrection
