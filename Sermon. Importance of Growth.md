Hebrews 6:1-8

1. The issue in Hebrews
    1. The book was written to Jewish Christians
        1. They have heard the Gospel
        2. They claim to have simply trusted in Jesus
    2. But when the temple was destroyed in Jerusalem - AD. 70
        1. Many felt disillusioned with religion
        2. Why would God abandon the temple
        3. They could not understand prophesy and were turning away from God
2. God is here admonishing them to continue
    1. Don't just throw out what you've learned - v. 1-3
    2. If needed, he will go over the basics
        1. But, the writer is hoping that they do understand and do believe
3. The impossibility of losing one's salvation - v. 4-6
    1. "if" means "if" in v. 6
        1. Too many believe that it is possible
        2. But, v. 4-5 clearly state that it isn't
    2. If a person could lose their salvation
        1. Then they can never be saved
        2. Jesus would have to die again
        3. They had already deemed the blood of Jesus of no value
        4. Anyone that claims it is basically making fun of God
4. They were never saved to begin with - v. 7-8
    1. God is again using the earth as a illustration
        1. Same as the parable of the sower - Matthew 13
    2. Good ground
        1. A saved person that is controlled by God
            1. bringing forth good fruit
        2. The ground stays good because God is giving it rain
        3. likewise, a saved person stays saved due to God's grace
            - Ephesians 4:30 "And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
            - เอเฟซัส 4:30 "อย่าทำให้พระวิญญาณเสียพระทัยและอย่าทำให้พระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์ของพระเจ้าเสียพระทัย เพราะโดยพระวิญญาณนั้นท่านได้ถูกประทับตราหมายท่านไว้จนถึงวันที่ทรงไถ่ให้รอด"
    3. Bad ground
        1. A lost person that is controlled by the cares of this world
            1. That ground only has Thorns (หนามใหญ่) and briars (หนามย่อย)
            2. No usable fruit
                - Luke 13:9 "And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down."
                - ลูกา 13:9 "แล้วถ้ามันเกิดผลก็ดีอยู่ ถ้าไม่เกิดผล ภายหลังท่านจงโค่นมันเสีย'""
        2. Thorns (หนามใหญ่) and briars (หนามย่อย) were cares of this world
        3. No matter how much rain (God's care) they are still producing thorns
