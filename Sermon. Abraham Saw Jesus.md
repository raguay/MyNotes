John 8:39-58

1. The Jews questioning Jesus about his identity 
	1. They wanted Him to say that He is the King.
		1. They thought that God's King would free them from the Romans.
		2. They were expecting a military leader like David or Joshua.
	2. They just want a man to rule them.
		1. So that they can blame him for problems.
		2. They don't want God to rule them.
2. But, Jesus goes against the norm
	1. Healing on the Sabbath day
	2. Telling them that God is His Father
	3. He has come to do God's will and not His will.
3. Their father
	1. Jesus tells them they follow the Devil
		1. They are trying to kill Jesus
		2. That wasn't something that Abraham did
		3. The devil has always followed murder like they are.
		4. Because they are following the devil, they can't understand Jesus’ words.
			1. The devil blinds people's minds to the truth.
				- 2 Corinthians 4:4 "In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
				- 2โครินธ์ 4:4 "ส่วนคนที่ไม่เชื่อนั้น พระของยุคนี้ได้กระทำใจของเขาให้มืดไป เพื่อไม่ให้ความสว่างของข่าวประเสริฐอันมีสง่าราศีของพระคริสต์ ผู้เป็นพระฉายของพระเจ้า ส่องแสงถึงพวกเขา"
					1. He's not old enough.
					2. He didn't follow the proper training.
					3. etc.
	2. The jews said God is their father
		1. Then they should rejoice
		2. Jesus came from God
		3. Instead, they want to kill him.
4. Jesus' Declaration of Abraham - v. 56-58
	1. Abraham rejoiced to see Jesus' day
		1. The verse is literally saying that Abraham saw Jesus in a Jewish sense.
	2. But, they said Jesus is less than 50 years old
		1. How could Abraham have seen you?
	3. Then Jesus declares
		1. "Before Abraham was, I AM"
			1. "I AM" is the name God told Abraham.
			2. The "am" declares He is alive.
			3. To give as a name, you would have to say "I have always been and will always be alive!"
		2. This is Jesus declaring that He is God.
			1. Whenever you say His name, you are declaring that God is alive and real.
			2. Just like you can tell someone that you saw me.
				1. I'm alive and real.
		3. Only God can use that name.
			1. Every person has a finite lifespan.
			2. We can't declare to have lived in every time frame.
5. Therefore, do you believe what Jesus said?
	1. Jesus is God that has always been and will always be alive!
	2. He is able to save you to the uttermost.
