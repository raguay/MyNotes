Colossians 3:14-17

1. Paul gives instruction on what to do after what not to do
    1. People listen to reproof more than what to do
    2. He gives reproof, then gives the way to not have to worry about it
    3. If we follow these few items, all the bad things will be done away
        1. because we will be following very close to God!
2. Six things to do:
    1. Have charity as a garment
        1. Loving others always
        2. You wouldn't leave your house naked would you?
            1. Then don't leave your house without demonstrating Love
        3. Like everyone can see what we wear, everyone should see our love for others
    2. Peace of God ruling your heart
        1. Not have God's peace, seek after God until you do
            1. Don't do anything without it
        2. An absence of God's peace means it wasn't God's will
            1. Therefore, it is sin because it's not by faith
    3. Be thankful
        1. For everything that happens to you: good or bad
            1. Because it is God's will
                - 1 Thessalonians 5:18 "In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you."
                - 1เธสะโลนิกา 5:18 "จงขอบพระคุณในทุกกรณี เพราะนี่แหละเป็นน้ำพระทัยของพระเจ้าในพระเยซูคริสต์เพื่อท่านทั้งหลาย"
            2. Bad things still happen to us because God allows it
                1. God doesn't cause bad things, sin in the world does
                2. But, God is able to stop the bad if He deams it necessary
        2. It's not thankful for the bad, but thankfully it's not even worse and God will help us through it.
            1. Not being thankful means we believe God caused it
        3. Not being thankful causes God's peace to go away very fast!
    4. Let the Word of God dwell richly within you
        1. That means to get it in your heart
        2. "richly" means the same as abundantly
            1. Not just a few verses here and there
            2. Whole chapters
            3. Meditating upon them continually
    5. Admonishing one another
        1. This isn't putting them down
        2. But, encouraging them to follow Christ
        3. By singing songs of faith that teach us to follow after Him
    6. Doing it all in the Name of Jesus Christ
        1. By doing what He would do
        2. If we can honestly say Christ is directing our steps, then we are doing it in Christ' name.
        3. If we are just doing what we want, then we are doing it in our name.
3. If you do these 6 simple things, the "don't"s will be easily avoided
    1. All the "don't"s are things according to the flesh
    2. Walking with Christ keeps us from performing the deeds of the flesh
        - Galatians 5:16 "This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
        - กาลาเทีย 5:16 "การดำเนินชีวิตตามพระวิญญาณ สงครามระหว่างเนื้อหนังกับพระวิญญาณแต่ข้าพเจ้าขอบอกว่า จงดำเนินชีวิตตามพระวิญญาณและท่านจะไม่สนองความต้องการของเนื้อหนัง"
