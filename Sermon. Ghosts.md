Job 4:15-19

1. What are Ghosts?
	1. They aren't
		1. Spirits of people who died
		2. Spirits of nature and planet
		3. Aliens from other dimensions
	2. They are
		1. Angel's that disobeyed God
			1. Telling a mixture of truth and lie
			2. God didn't charge all the angels with folly, just those that disobeyed
	3. They try to push wrong 
		1. Here, they are trying to say that Job is being disciplined for sin
		2. Just because we have problems doesn't mean we have sinned
			1. Other than the fact that we all sin everyday
			2. Job regularly obeyed God's commands and gave a sacrifice for his sins and his children's sins
			3. Job's faith was in a redeemer to come signified by the sacrifice
2. They should not be listened to
	- 1 John 4:1 "Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world."
	- 1ยอห์น 4:1 "จงพิสูจน์วิญญาณทั้งหลายท่านที่รักทั้งหลาย อย่าเชื่อวิญญาณเสียทุกๆวิญญาณ แต่จงพิสูจน์วิญญาณเหล่านั้นว่ามาจากพระเจ้าหรือไม่ เพราะว่ามีผู้พยากรณ์เท็จเป็นอันมากออกเที่ยวไปในโลก"
		1. God says not to believe every spirit
			1. Not everything comes from God
		  	2. Evil spirits that rebelled against God want to destroy God's work
		2. Therefore, we need to be careful
			1. They often look like God's messengers
			2. They can seem like someone we know
			3. They most often sound (to our ears without seeing them) like ourselves.
		3. Try them to see if they are from God
			1. God never goes against His Word
			2. Ghosts always mix truth with falsehood
			3. As Satan twisted God's word when tempting Jesus
