Acts 10:34-48

1. Cornelius 
	1. A Centurion of the Italian band
		1. He was a born in Italy and was a Roman citizen by birth
		2. Most of his soldiers were from Rome as well
		3. Romans are ordered by law to worship the Emperor as the only god
			1. Therefore, for him to worship the true God is no small deal
			2. It has caused him much problems in his career 
	2. He loved the Jewish people and helped them all he could
		1. Built them places of worship
	3. He prayed to God the Father everyday and fasted twice a week
	4. He practiced the Jewish religion very carefully
2. God sent an angel to Cornelius
	1. Told him to call Peter to explain to him the way of God
	2. He immediately sent his workers to call on Peter
3. Peter was taught of God
	1. Not to look down on Gentiles
	2. God would receive them just as much as a Jew
	3. Peter went with them and preached the gospel
4. Cornelius, friends and family believed in God
	1. They were eager to hear from God
		1. As soon as the Angel told him to send to Peter, he sent them
		2. He knew it would take a while as the distance was a days journey
	2. They received God's word
		1. When Peter preached unto them, they accepted it as God's Word
			1. Something that God Himself was telling them
			2. They accepted it as something that would help them and be good for them
				1. Like we trust a doctor to give good advice and medicine
				2. We take what he gives without doubting
	3. They believed and received the Holy Ghost immediately
		1. They only trusted in God's Word as truth
			1. Not church membership
			2. Not family ties
			3. Not nationality
			4. Not on any merit of their own
		2. They willing accepted Jesus is the only God in their lives
			1. They were willing to follow Him
		3. God honored that by saving them!
			1. Immediately receiving the Holy Spirit
				1. They spoke in other languages
				2. Since Peter understood it as praising God, they most likely spoke in Hebrew. 
					1. None of them would have known Hebrew before that day!
				3. It was to prove to the Jews that they were saved
			2. The Holy Spirit is the down payment for complete salvation
				- 2 Corinthians 1:22 'Who hath also sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.'   
				- 2 โครินเธียน 1:22 'และพระองค์ทรงประทับตราเรา และประทานพระวิญญาณไว้ในใจของเราเป็นมัดจำด้วย'
5. Peter then had them baptized
	1. The Holy Spirit showed them they were saved
	2. Then they accepted baptism to demonstrate their faith
		1. It didn't save them
		2. They were just obeying God's Word
	3. A church or pastor doesn't decide who is saved, just God
		1. Therefore, Peter couldn't deny them the right to follow God
