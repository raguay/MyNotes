Luke 16:10-13

1. The "little", "small", or easy things in Christian life that God commands us to be faithful in:
    1. Bible study
    2. Prayer
    3. Witnessing
    4. Faithful Church attendance
2. Those that **ARE** faithful in little
    1. Doing it:
        1. willingly
        2. with love and not necessity
        3. doing it because we love God
            - not what we get back, reward
            - not because others will praise us
            - not because we have too
3. Those that **AREN'T** faithful in little
    1. When we just don't do them
        1. at all
        2. rarely or occasionally do them
    2. When we do it because:
        1. we have to
        2. we want to get something
        3. we want others to think good of us
    3. Basically, if you have to be treated like a 2 year old, you are unfaithful to the things of God.
        1. An adult is faithful with work because he knows he needs to be
        2. A child has to be told to work always and reminded constantly
4. True Riches
    1. Only the faithful are entrusted with the true riches of God
        1. Power of God to perform His will
            1. God has a special job for everyone to do
            2. God empowered men and women because they were faithful
                - Moses, Joshua, Hannah, Elijah, Peter, Paul, etc
        2. Greater understanding of God's Word
        3. Wisdom for a peaceful life
        4. God's blessings
5. Faithful in another man's
    1. God gave us life, therefore, it's God's Life, not our life
    2. God gives us the ability to make money, so it's God's money
    3. Therefore, we need to be faithful with what God gives us
        1. Use our lives and money as God directs
    4. If we aren't faithful is the "little" things, why would God entrust us with the larger things?
6. Can you be entrusted with the greater things in a Christian life?
