John 10:24-30

1. The Jews wanted to know if Jesus was the Messiah
	1. But, they only wanted a human Messiah, not God himself
		1. They are only looking for a human to deliver them out of the Romans control
		2. They want to control their own lives
	2. They wanted to follow a man 
		1. to look good
		2. to blame when things go wrong
	3. They really aren't interested in God leading them
		1. Can't really blame God when things do not go your way!
		2. They can't look good to others when it is God that does the work. IE: No Boasting!
2. Jesus explains why they don't understand
	1. They weren't His sheep
		1. Jesus' sheep long to hear and obey His voice
			1. Not interested in boasting, just following
		2. They can not die
			1. Their spirit has eternal life in heaven
			2. die in the Bible refers to eternal separation from God in Hell, Lake of Fire!
		3. They are in God's hand and no one can pluck them out.
			1. Not even themselves!
			2. Very important. Salvation can't be lost!
	2. Jesus and God are one!
		1. Those that want to be His sheep have to understand and trust in this point.
			1. Jesus is God almighty!
			2. There is only one God!
		2. Those that follow without believing this point are fake Christians
			1. They still want to be their own boss.
			2. They are not willing to hear AND obey His voice.
3. Whose Voice do you hear and OBEY
	1. Self is the same as Satan
		1. Then you are lost
		2. Or, very disobedient
			1. God will be disciplining unless truly lost
	2. Jesus', then you are saved
