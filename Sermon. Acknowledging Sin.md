Psalms 32:5 "I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah."

สดุดี 32:5 "ข้าพระองค์สารภาพบาปของข้าพระองค์ต่อพระองค์ และข้าพระองค์มิได้ซ่อนความชั่วช้าของข้าพระองค์ไว้ ข้าพระองค์ทูลว่า "ข้าพระองค์จะสารภาพการละเมิดของข้าพระองค์ต่อพระเยโฮวาห์" แล้วพระองค์ทรงยกโทษความชั่วช้าแห่งความบาปของข้าพระองค์ เซลาห์"

1. The first step to getting help is acknowledging there is a problem
    1. Alcoholics and drug addicts don't quit until they acknowledge the problem
    2. Anything bad about you that you want to change has to be dealt with
        1. If you don't see a problem, you will never fix it
        2. Leaks in the roof stay as leaks until someone finds them and fixes them.
        3. No one searches for a problem or solution until they believe that they need to.
        4. No one truly believes there is a problem without trying to fix it.
            1. No desire to fix a problem means they don't truly believe it is a problem
2. David is here acknowledging his sin before God
    1. He agreed with God
    2. He accepted God's view on his sin
    3. He believed he was worthy of the punishment for the sin
        1. Eternity in Hell
    4. He was then able to truly ask for forgiveness
        1. He acknowledged the awfulness of the sin and wanted rid of it
        2. He truly wanted to live for God and not for sin
    5. God forgave him of the sin
        1. Not just the sin, but the evil behind the sin
        2. Sin really isn't the main issue, but the mind that hates God's ways
        3. Evil thoughts and intents of the heart is the evil of sin
3. This is why David was known as the one after the heart of God
    1. He was honest about himself before God
    2. He saw his sins as worthy of the worst judgement
    3. He sought out God to forgive and help him stop the evil of sin
4. Are you acknowledging your sin before God?
    1. Just saying sorry without truly believing it's a problem does no good.
