Matthew 18:23-35

1. A servant owed money to his master
    1. He didn't have the money when the master called in the debt
    2. He begged mercy from his master
    3. The master forgave the servant all his debt
        1. The servant didn't have to pay any back
        2. He was totally forgive as though he never had any debt
    4. The servant went and found another servant that owed him money
        1. He demanded payment right then
        2. The fellow servant begged for mercy and time to pay off his debt
        3. The first servant refused and put him in prison until he paid it off
            1. No one can make money in prison, so it was a life sentence
    5. The master heard of the servant's unforgiveness
        1. Turned him over to the tormentors
            1. People who inflicted pain until the debt is paid
            2. Since he can't work, the pain continues
        2. The idea is that he would be tormented as long as his fellow servant is in prison
2. Application to our lives
    1. The first servant's problem
        1. He was forgiven all his debt
        2. But, he refused to forgive others debts to himself
    2. Application to us
        1. We accept God's forgiven for our sins
            1. We trust in Jesus for salvation from the penalty of our sin
            2. We willing to follow after Jesus and accept His ways
        2. Then someone does wrong to us
            1. They should show love to us, but instead show hatred
            2. If we react with unforgiveness, we are acting like the first servant that refused to forgive others
                1. We accept that God forgives us
                    1. We can't pay our debt of sin
                    2. We accept God's forgiveness
                2. We should then forgive others in the same way
                    1. Forgive them their debt to us regardless if they pay anything back
                3. But, if we don't, God turns us over to tormentors
                    1. physical illnesses
                    2. mental illnesses
                    3. Until we pay all of our own debt
