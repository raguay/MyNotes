Ecclesiastes 4:9-12

1. Being alone
    1. When problems happen, there is no one to help
    2. We often can't help ourselves
        1. Like lift ourself up
    3. A person by themselves can't stay warm
        1. They get cold
2. Two people
    1. They can help each other
    2. One falls, the other helps them get up
    3. Two people can stay warm
        1. Being close to each other they share heat
    4. But, they have to agree to help each other
        1. Not being in agreement keeps them from being together
        2. Even though around each other, disagreements keep them apart
3. Three people
    1. Nothing can easily stop them
        1. Three and more people working towards a common goal
        2. They can do almost anything as long as they are in agreement
    2. But, disagreeing keeps them from working together
        1. The same as them not being near each other
    3. Just like the tower of Babel
        1. God said since there isn't any disputing, man can do anything they want to do.
        2. God changed man's languages to keep them from doing more sin.
4. The church
    1. The smallest church is two people and God
        - Matthew 18:20 "For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them."
        - มัทธิว 18:20 "ด้วยว่ามีสองสามคนประชุมกันที่ไหนๆในนามของเรา เราจะอยู่ท่ามกลางเขาที่นั่น""
    2. They will be unstoppable
        - Matthew 16:18 "And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
        - มัทธิว 16:18 "ฝ่ายเราบอกท่านด้วยว่า ท่านคือเปโตร และบนศิลานี้เราจะสร้างคริสตจักรของเราไว้ และประตูแห่งนรกจะมีชัยต่อคริสตจักรนั้นก็หามิได้"
    3. But, they have to be in agreement
        - Amos 3:3 "Can two walk together, except they be agreed?"
        - อาโมส 3:3 "สองคนจะเดินไปด้วยกันได้หรือนอกจากทั้งสองจะได้ตกลงกันไว้ก่อน"
            1. The church is only stopped by disagreements
                1. Members not agreeing with God
                    1. We have to agree that
                        1. We are all sinners
                        2. We can't decide our own lives
                        3. We need to walk with God daily!
                2. Members not agreeing with each other
                    1. Wanting their own agenda, not following God
                    2. God will lead the whole church in the right direction
                        1. But, only if each member is yielded to God
                3. That is satan's program for the church
                    1. Create as much discord as possible!
5. Are you in agreement
    1. With God?
    2. With others that are following Go?
    3. With the church?
