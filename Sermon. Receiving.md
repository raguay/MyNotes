Mark 10:29-30 

1. Christ is talking about a Christian that
   1. Willing to leave all to follow God's leading
      1. family, friends, culture, and everything familiar
      2. Mostly describes a missionary or pastor in a different area
      3. But, can also refer to those that follow God
         1. Following God more than culture, family, and friends
         2. When family, friends, and culture are totally opposed to the Gospel and living for Christ
   2. Receives a great promise
      1. a hundred fold more houses, family, friends than before
      2. Eternal life
         1. Because, this is a trait that distinguishes a true Christian
         2. A fake Christian will not willingly accept persecutions
      3. benefits of knowing another culture
         1. God's heavenly culture
         2. If a missionary, other cultures in this world
   3. But at a price
      1. With persecutions
         1. People not understanding the way you do things
         2. Others will think that their way is better
         3. People actively trying to stop God's work
            1. Non-Christians
            2. Christians as well
               1. Because we show them how they should be and they don't want it.
               2. The reminder that they aren't living for God is painful to them
         4. Issues with governments, paperwork, visas
            1. Many governments actively oppose those that walk with Christ
         5. The people never truly accept you as one of "them"
            1. You will always be an outsider (Missionary)
2. Seeking God and His righteousness
   - Matthew 6:33 "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
   - มัทธิว 6:33 "แต่ท่านทั้งหลายจงแสวงหาอาณาจักรของพระเจ้า และความชอบธรรมของพระองค์ก่อน แล้วพระองค์จะทรงเพิ่มเติมสิ่งทั้งปวงเหล่านี้ให้แก่ท่าน"
      1. God will give what we need
      2. The other verse promises more than we need
         1. But, this one is just about doing the bare minimum for God
         2. No persecutions are listed here
      3. But, when we honestly seek after God, there are persecutions
         - 2 Timothy 3:12 "Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
         - 2ทิโมธี 3:12 "แท้จริงทุกคนที่ปรารถนาจะดำเนินชีวิตตามทางของพระเจ้าในพระเยซูคริสต์จะถูกกดขี่ข่มเหง"
            1. Anyone that lives as Christ would live will face persecutions
               1. Not might or maybe
               2. Will definitely meet persecution
            2. Therefore, if you never face persecutions for following Christ
               1. Your not doing it!
               2. Your doing your own thing.
               3. Don't expect the rewards God promises in the first point
