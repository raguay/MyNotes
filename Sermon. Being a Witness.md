Acts 1:8

1. We shall be witnesses
   1. It's not as much of a command
   2. It's more of a by product of trusting in Jesus
2. Where shall we witness?
   1. Jerusalem
      1. This means where you currently are.
      2. The disciples were currently in Jerusalem.
   2. Samaria
      1. Those that are near to you, but you don't particularly like
      2. The Jews did not like the Samaritans because they were half breeds (ลูกครึ่ง)
   3. Through out the world
      1. Everywhere else
