1 Kings 17:1-6

1. God gave Elijah a job
	1. Tell King Ahab that there wouldn't be rain or dew (น้ำค้าง) for three years
		1. At first, Ahab didn't believe it
		2. After a while, Ahab searched hard to find Elijah to force him to make it rain
	2. Elijah had to walk close to God to hear that
		1. Because that means he would have a hard time as well
		2. We often don't hear that which we do not want to hear
			1. We have to be willing to hear bad news as well as good news
2. Then God had Elijah move where he lived
	1. He was to live at a specific brook of water
	2. He wasn't to leave until God said so
	3. That is where God commanded the birds to feed him
		1. Bread every morning
		2. Meat every night
	4. This is contrary to their nature
		1. Birds will eat enough for them first then for their young
		2. But, for other, never
3. If Elijah didn't go there
	1. Ahab would of found him and most likely killed him
	2. Elijah would not be fed during the drought
		1. He would of died of starvation
4. It is important for us to be in the location God wants us
	1. It is a place of
		1. Protection
		2. Supply
	2. But you can only get there by
		1. Listening to God daily
			1. If you listen on Sunday, but not Monday, God might be calling you then
			2. You would miss out on God's great blessing!
5. Others that found their supply from God
	1. Adam and Eve
		1. God placed them in the garden
		2. They had all their needs met there
		3. Sin, not willing to follow God, made them loose it all
	2. Abraham
		1. God made him a great nation in the place that God chose for him
		2. He had to walk with God daily to get there since he didn't know the way
6. Are you where God wants you to be?
