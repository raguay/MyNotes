Judges 17:1-5

about 16 years after Settling in

1. Confusion
    1. Micah's mother's money dedicated to the Lord was stolen
        1. She dedicated it after it was stolen
        2. Might as well, she no longer had it
            1. Giving to God that which we don't have isn't giving
    2. Micah admits stealing
        1. No punishment
        2. Treated as stealing was okay since he returned it
            1. Micah never learned of it as sin
    3. She takes a part of it and makes an idol to the Lord.
        1. The Lord prohibits idols!!!
            - Exodus 20:23 "Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold."
            - อพยพ 20:23 "เจ้าอย่าทำรูปพระด้วยเงินไว้สำหรับบูชาเทียมเท่ากับเรา หรือทำรูปพระด้วยทองคำสำหรับตัว"
        2. The majority she used for herself
            1. Her giving was for appearance only
            2. Not ginuine giving to God
    4. Made his son a priest
        1. only the line of Aaron can be priests
2. Everyone picked and chose what they like about religion without reguards to the truth!
    1. They did what they saw as right
        - Judges 17:6 "In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes."
        - ผู้วินิจฉัย 17:6 "ในสมัยนั้นยังไม่มีกษัตริย์ในอิสราเอล ทุกคนทำตามอะไรก็ตามที่ถูกต้องในสายตาของตนเอง"
    2. But, man's heart is wicked
        - Jeremiah 17:9 "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"
        - เยเรมีย์ 17:9 "จิตใจก็เป็นตัวล่อลวงเหนือกว่าสิ่งใดทั้งหมด มันเสื่อมทรามอย่างร้ายทีเดียว ผู้ใดจะรู้จักใจนั้นเล่า"
    3. Therefore, man's will is always against God's will
3. Are we picking and choosing what we want from God's word?
    1. We want his help
        1. Salvation
        2. Easy life
        3. No problems
        4. Peace of mind
    2. But, we only want what is easy in God's word
        1. Reading God's word is too hard
        2. Praying isn't fun
        3. Witnessing will get me in trouble, no thank you.
    3. Just like Micah and his mom
        1. We just want what we like from God and nothing more!
4. Confess this sin and ask God to help us accept all of His Word!
