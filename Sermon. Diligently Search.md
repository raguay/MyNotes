Acts 17:10-12

1. The people in Berea
    1. Listened attentively to the Gospel and all of Paul's teachings
    2. They searched the Scriptures themselves to 
        1. Made sure Paul wasn't a deceiver
        2. Made sure they remembered each point
        3. Applied the lessons to their lives
    3. Many believed
2. We should be the same
    1. Listen attentively to Bible teaching
    2. Study the word to make sure the teaching matches God's Word
    3. Make the truth learned a part of our lives
3. The by-product will be
    1. We will desire to walk with God more
        1. The Word of God is our food
            - 1 Peter 2:2 "As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby:"
            - 1เปโตร 2:2 "เช่นเดียวกับทารกแรกเกิด จงปรารถนาน้ำนมอันบริสุทธิ์แห่งพระวจนะ เพื่อจะทำให้ท่านทั้งหลายเติบโตขึ้น"
        2. We desire to be with the person that give the food: Jesus!
    2. People will see our lives transformed by God and His Word
        1. Many will get saved
        2. Others in the church will be encouraged to do the same
    3. We will be profitable servants to Jesus
        1. The only thing Jesus lacks is more people serving Him and loving Him
        2. He owns everything, but love has to be freely given
