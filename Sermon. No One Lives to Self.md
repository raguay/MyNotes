Romans 14:7 "For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself."

โรม 14:7 "เพราะในพวกเราไม่มีผู้ใดมีชีวิตอยู่เพื่อตนเองฝ่ายเดียว และไม่มีผู้ใดตายเพื่อตนเองฝ่ายเดียว"

1. Our lives always affects others
    1. Family
    2. Friends
    3. Co-workers
    4. Neighbors
    5. Others in our church
    6. God
2. All decisions or lack of decisions effects them all
    1. Everything we do and don't do has effects
    2. If you hurt someone, that hurt lasts longer than the "I'm sorry" does.
    3. If you don't help someone in need, their need keeps going unmet
    4. If we do something that shortens our life
        1. It effects everyone in a negative way
3. We need to realize the effect we have and use our life to help more than hurt.
    1. That is why we really need to walk in the Spirit
    2. Only God truly understands our actions and lack of actions and how they affect others.
