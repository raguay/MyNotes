1 Peter 1:17-21 

1. Faith and Hope
	1. Faith is believing what we can not see
		- Hebrews 11:1 "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."
		- ฮีบรู 11:1 "ความเชื่อได้แสดงออกโดยบุคคลแห่งความเชื่อบัดนี้ความเชื่อคือความแน่ใจในสิ่งที่เราหวังไว้ เป็นหลักฐานมั่นใจว่า สิ่งที่ยังไม่ได้เห็นนั้นมีจริง"
	2. Things we can do don't require faith and hope
		1. We can see how to do it our way
		2. There isn't a need for hope
		3. It is tangibly before our eyes
		4. Therefore, has nothing to do with Faith
	3. Things we can't do requires faith and hope
	      1. We have to trust in others
	      2. Hoping for their full help
	      3. That hope is based on a promise
	4. If we have no hope, we have no faith!
2. Can only be in God
	1. God's work for us
	2. God's sacrifice for us
	3. God's foreknowledge of us
	4. Forever ours due to it's being incorruptible
3. Therefore, God can judge us without respect to who we are
      1. Because our salvation is based on Faith 
            1. in God
            2. not self
      2. Therefore, our works show us our true heart
		  1. Trusting ourselves
		  2. Trusting God
	   3. If we are trusting ourselves
		  1. We should fear Hell
		  2. Our hearts sometimes tell us we are trusting God, when we really are trusting what we did for God
			  1. Fear in times of difficulty can show that we do not truly have faith and trust in God
