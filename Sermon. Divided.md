Matthew 12:24-26,30 "But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand: And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?...He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not with me scattereth abroad."

1. Divided loyalty
    1. Any group that isn't working together is divided
        1. Some not doing anything
        2. Some working
        3. Some doing the work differently
            1. Doing it their way
    2. Not doing the leader's will and direction
        1. He is the leader and directs the work
        2. If the leader interferes with a worker
            1. The work doesn't get done
        3. If the worker isn't following the leader
            1. The wrong things get done or nothing gets done
2. Gathering
    1. Is leading others to Christ
        1. It is what God has called us to do
        2. It should be our goal everyday
        3. Looking to God for our daily work and walk
    2. We do it by following our Leader - Jesus
        1. When we walk with him, he leads us to witness and lead others to Him
        2. Our daily lives need to be under His direction in order for us to be gathering with Him!
3. Scattering
    1. Doing it our way
        1. Living for self interests
        2. Not trying to be close to God
    2. Doing nothing
        1. Just going through the motions
4. Are we with or against Christ?
    1. If we are gathering, we are loyal to and working with Christ
    2. If we are scattering, we are the enemy!
