Nehemiah 1:5-11

1. Nehemiah heard about the problems in Jerusalem
	1. Israel was allowed to go back home
	2. Some of Israel went back, but not everyone
	3. Some of his kin came back to inform Nehemiah what it was like.
		- Nehemiah 1:3 "And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire."
		- เนหะมีย์ 1:3 "เขาทั้งหลายพูดกับข้าพเจ้าว่า "ผู้ที่เหลือจากพวกที่ถูกกวาดไปเป็นเชลยซึ่งอยู่ในมณฑลมีความลำบากและความอับอายมาก กำแพงเมืองเยรูซาเล็มก็พังลง และประตูเมืองก็ถูกไฟทำลายเสีย""
			1. The wall of the city was totally destroyed
				1. That means, no protection from night time beasts or robbers
2. Nehemiah started praying
	1. He reminded God that He is merciful
	2. He promised to keep His eyes and ears open to the prayers of His people
	3. He confessed all the sins of Israel
	4. He prayed God's promises back to him
	5. Asked God to listen to the prayers of his people
	6. Finally, asked favor with the Persian King
		1. He is the cup bearer for the king
		2. There is a law that anyone coming before the king sad is sentence to death if the king wants.
3. This is a great example of a prayer
	1. Confess sins - you and your nation
	2. Pray the promises of God in His Word
	3. Then pray for specific items in your life
