Luke 17:7-10

1. A servant
    1. One that is purchased to do work
        1. In Israel, it was the social reform program for those that are heavily in debt.
        2. For a period of 7 years until the release
    2. Since they are purchased, they are expected to work!
        1. They are to work when, where, how the boss says
        2. They don't make their own decisions
            1. The boss gives them a place to live
            2. clothes to wear
            3. food to eat
2. Giving thanks
    1. When we help others, they thank us
        1. It's because we don't have to help, but we do
        2. They are thankful for what we do out of love or kindness to them
        3. They understand we do not have a responsibility to do that work
    2. But, a servant is just doing what the master says
        1. He isn't doing more than the master expects
        2. He only is doing what is expected of him
            1. He got himself into a mess and the master bailed him out
            2. Therefore, the servant works for the master, but the master doesn't thank him, it's expected!
3. Unprofitable
    1. The servant is "unprofitable" due to the fact that the servant isn't doing more than was expected.
        1. It's not possible, because a servant is expected to give his life to the work his master gives him
        2. The servant isn't adding to what the master has purchased
4. Christians are the same: unprofitable servants
    1. We were purchased by the blood of Jesus Christ
        - 1 Peter 1:18-19 "Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers; But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:"
        - 1เปโตร 1:18-19 "ท่านรู้ว่า พระองค์ได้ทรงไถ่ท่านทั้งหลายออกจากการประพฤติอันหาสาระมิได้ ซึ่งท่านได้รับเป็นประเพณีต่อจากบรรพบุรุษของท่าน มิได้ไถ่ไว้ด้วยสิ่งที่เสื่อมสลายได้ เช่นเงินและทอง แต่ทรงไถ่ด้วยพระโลหิตอันมีราคามากของพระคริสต์ ดังเลือดลูกแกะที่ปราศจากตำหนิหรือจุดด่างพร้อย"
            1. Our sins made us a debtor to God
            2. God purchased us with His own blood
            3. Therefore, we are His servants
    2. God expects us to work
        - Ephesians 2:10 "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
        - เอเฟซัส 2:10 "เพราะว่าเราเป็นฝีพระหัตถ์ของพระองค์ ที่ทรงสร้างขึ้นในพระเยซูคริสต์ เพื่อให้ประกอบการดีซึ่งพระเจ้าได้ทรงดำริไว้ล่วงหน้าเพื่อให้เราดำเนินตามนั้น"
		    1. Our work is not our decision, but God's
		        1. Where, how, when
		    2. Nothing we do has added anything to God
		        1. Because He already owns everything
		    3. But, God does reward us in Heaven!
5. Are you a good servant?
