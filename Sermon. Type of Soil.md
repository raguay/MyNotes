Luke 8:5-8

1. This parable shows that people have four types of heart
    1. Foot path heart
        1. Very hard
        2. Nothing with life lives on it
    2. Rocky heart
        1. Looks good and grows quickly
        2. But, has no endurance for problems
            1. Only wants God to give to them
            2. They aren't interested in living for Him or suffering with Him
    3. Thorny heart
        1. Caring for things of this world keeps them from following God
    4. Good heart
        1. Follows God
        2. Lot's of fruit because they witness as they walk with God
2. Two types are religious lost people
    1. Foot path and Rocky heart
    2. They like to look the part, but not interesting in following God
3. Two types are Christians
    1. Thorny and Good hearts
4. But, all Christians show the parts of each sometimes
    1. We don't always follow God as we should
    2. We get lazy on God
