Job 26:4 "To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?"
โยบ 26:4 "ท่านเปล่งวาจาออกมาแก่ใครเล่า และวิญญาณของใครได้ออกมาจากท่าน"

1. Job is admonishing his friends
    1. Who do they think they are talking too?
    2. Who is leading their conversation?
2. We need to keep this in mind as well
    1. Do we really think about who we are talking to?
        1. God created everyone
        2. Therefore, everyone is God's servant - whether they want to or not.
        3. We can only command and reprimand our own servants, not someone else's.
        4. Also, God hears everything we say or think about someone
            1. Therefore, when we talk to others, we are talking to God also
            2. Would you say what you do say to God alone?
                1. If not, refrain from speaking!
    2. Who is controlling or leading our speech?
        1. God should be who leads our speech
            1. God never leads into 
                1. arguments and hate filled speech
                2. Looking down on others
                3. Anything that would be against God's Word
            2. God wants us to speak in love
                - Ephesians 4:15 "But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:"
                - เอเฟซัส 4:15 "แต่ให้เราพูดความจริงด้วยใจรักเพื่อจะจำเริญขึ้นทุกอย่างสู่พระองค์ผู้เป็นศีรษะคือพระคริสต์"
                    1. Truth often does hurt, but is much better spoken in love
        2. We often speak 
            1. from self
                1. More often than not is 
                    1. prideful
                    2. hurtful to others
                2. Therefore, is sin also
            2. from the world's perspective
                1. very self centered
                2. looking to self profit more than helping others.
            3. from satan
                1. is always sinful and wrong
