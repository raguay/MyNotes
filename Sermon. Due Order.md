 1 Chronicles 15:13-14 - For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order. So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

1. There was a proper way to move the Ark
	1. The Levites are to bare it on their shoulders 
	2. But, they tried moving it on a new cart
		1. Just like the Philistines did
		2. It wasn’t what God directed, but it was the world’s method
	3. Therefore, there was a death - 1 Chronicles 13
		1. Uzziah touched the Ark because the ox stumbled 
2. Similarly, God has a proper order for our service to God
	- Romans 12:1-2 ”I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.“
		1. Just like the Levites had to
			1. Sanctified themselves: same as giving themselves a living sacrifice to God
			2. Accept the proper way to move the Ark: same as receiving the renewing of our mind
			3. Then they knew the will of God and received His blessing
3. Many Christians aren’t following God according to His will
	1. They follow the world’s method
		1. Do what they want while looking like good Christians 
	2. All the while God’s work isn’t getting done
		- ‭‭1 Peter‬ ‭4‬:‭10‬ ”As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.“
			1. As we received the free gift of salvation, let us minister it to others
				1. Even to those in foreign lands
			2. There isn’t enough missionaries
				1. God is calling, but many aren’t willing to hear God
					- Hebrews 5:11 "Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing ye are dull of hearing."
				2. Some hear, but aren’t willing to stay with it
					1. Like Saul hearing Samuel instruct him, but did not follow through completely.
					2. Listening to others around him instead of God
4. The consequences of being like the world
	1. People aren’t getting reached
		- Luke‬ ‭10‬:‭2‬ ‭”Therefore said he unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few: pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.“
	2. Christian’s aren't receiving God’s blessings 
		1. In 1 Kings 17:1-6 - The ravens could only feed Elijah if he was were God told him to be
	3. Church’s don’t have God’s blessings
		- ‭‭‭‭1 Corinthians‬ ‭12‬:‭26‬ ‭”And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.“
5. How about you?
	1. Are you willing to do whatever God wants you to do?
	2. Have you presented yourself to God to do His will?
