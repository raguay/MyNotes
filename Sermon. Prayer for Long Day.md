1. Because of Joshua's lack of prayer
	1. Israel made a covenant with the Gibeonites
		1. They would be spared due to them tricking Joshua and the elders of Israel
		2. But, they would be permanent slaves to the children of Israel, especially to the house of God

3. Joshua goes to battle
	1. God tells him in the way that they will win
