2 Timothy 3:13-17

1. There are evil people
    1. They change God's word according to their desires
    2. They love self over following God
    3. But, they think they love the Lord
        1. They seduce others because they have been seduced already
        2. They can't see the delusions that they are in
        3. It usually stems from the fact they don't want to serve
2. There is only one defense
    1. Stick with God's Word
    2. Timothy had been taught God's Word from a child
        1. His mother and grandmother followed God
        2. His Dad was a Greek and had his own gods
    3. The only way to keep from being seduced by our own hearts and the devil's will is by God's Word
        1. Not just part either
        2. We have to take the whole Word of God
        3. All of God's Word is profitable
            1. doctrine
            2. reproof
            3. correction
            4. instruction in righteousness:
        4. The result is that we will be fit to serve God
3. Therefore, to serve God, you need to be in God's Word always
