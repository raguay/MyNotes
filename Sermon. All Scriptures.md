2 Timothy 3:13-17

1. There are evil people
    1. Which means, people that don't want to walk with God
        1. God is good, therefore, when anyone walks after self and not God they are without God - ie: Evil
    2. They change God's word according to their desires
    3. They love self over following God
    4. But, they think they love the Lord
        1. They seduce others because they have been seduced already
        2. They can't see the delusions that they are in
        3. It usually stems from the fact they don't want to serve
2. There is only one defense
    1. Stick with God's Word
        - Psalms 119:11: 'Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.'
        - สดูดี 119:11 'ข้าพระองค์ได้สะสมพระดำรัสของพระองค์ไว้ในใจของข้าพระองค์ เพื่อข้าพระองค์จะไม่ทำบาปต่อพระองค์'
            1. Actively memorizing God's Word helps us to sin less
    2. Timothy had been taught God's Word from a child
        1. His mother and grandmother followed God
        2. His Dad was a Greek and had his own gods - assumed because there is no mention of him in the Bible or anywhere else.
    3. The only way to keep from being seduced by our own hearts and the devil's will is by God's Word
        1. Not just part either
            1. Everything in God's Word should be studied
                - 2 Peter 1:20: 'Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.'
                - 2 เปโตร 1:20 'จงรู้ข้อนี้ก่อน คือว่าคำพยากรณ์ทุกคำที่จารึกไว้ในพระคัมภีร์แล้ว ไม่มีใครตีความได้ตามลำพังใจของตนเอง'
                    1. If we don't study all of it, the parts we do we will not properly understand.
                    2. It takes understand all of scripture to keep from being deceived.
        2. All of God's Word is profitable for
            1. doctrine - การสอน
            2. reproof - ตักเตือนว่ากล่าว
            3. correction - ปรับปรุงแก้ไข
            4. instruction in righteousness - อบรมในเรื่องความชอบธรรม
        3. The result is that we will be fit to serve God
3. Therefore, to serve God, you need to be in God's Word always
