2 Chronicles 20:5-25

1. King Jehoshaphat had a problem
	1. The people around Juda, Ammon, Seir, and Moab, are fighting them
		1. They are the descendants of Lot and Ishmael
		2. God gave them the mountains around and near Juda for an inheritance
	2. They have a larger army than Juda
	3. There is no way for Jehoshaphat to win
2. He prays for deliverance
	1. Tells how God is greater than everything in the world
	2. How God told Israel to not conquer them
	3. Now they repay that kindness by attacking while Juda is weak
	4. He prays for God to judge their deeds
		1. Because it is God's job
		2. He is the great judge of the world
3. God promises to deliver them
	1. They just go and watch
	2. They will not have to fight at all
4. Ammon, Seir, and Moab kill each other
	1. As all of Juda sing praises to God
	2. They attach each other
	3. Then they attach themselves
	4. All of them die
5. Juda simply goes down and bury the dead and get the spoil
	1. It takes them 3 days
