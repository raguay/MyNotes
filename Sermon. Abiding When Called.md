1 Corinthians 7:17-24

1. A problem arose when people got saved
	1. They figured they could do whatever they wanted
		1. People were leaving their families that didn't trust in Jesus
		2. Slaves were leaving their masters and giving Christians a bad name
			1. Not just slaves, but people in debt were not paying their debts as well
			2. When we owe a debt, we are servants to the one holding the debt.
				1. We can't just change jobs and move if God calls us to work somewhere else
	2. They miss understood the meaning of "Freedom in Christ"
		1. They thought since they are now Christians that they are free from all other responsibilities.
	3. Lost people saw their actions and were bad mouthed them
		1. Because they were being disrespectful and mean
		2. They disobeyed the law
		3. It was causing all kinds of issues and problems.
2. God is re-affirming the truth
	1. If they are married when they get saved, they are not to leave their families
		1. If their unbelieving spouse leaves, let them, but don't remarry
		2. If they stay with them, then you don't leave but stay with them and be an example of Christ before them
	2. If they are slaves when they get saved, to abide in their service to their masters with love and respect
		1. If their master frees them from being a slave, then use their freedom to serve Christ.
	3. If they are free from service to others, they we are to serve Christ
		1. Don't let yourself get entangled as a slave to men
			1. Debt
			2. Servitude to other people
		2. Don't marry an unbeliever if you were single when you got saved
			1. Lost spouse doesn't help a Christian serve Christ, but hinders them instead.
3. The idea is that we don't throw away our old life when we get saved
	1. We do quit things that are sin
	2. But we stay with our families, jobs, service, etc. and serve Christ in them
		1. God will not call us to do something against the law or that will hurt others
		2. If God calls us to change jobs, God will open the doors to do it properly
