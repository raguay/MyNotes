# Forsake Foolishness

Proverbs 9:6 "Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding."

สุภาษิต 9:6 "จงทิ้งความเขลาเสีย และดำรงชีวิตอยู่ ดำเนินในทางของความเข้าใจนั้นเถิด""

1. Foolishness
	1. Is a lifestyle more than an action
		1. Taking that which is popular and doing it because it is popular
		2. A mode of living that only seeks the here and now
		3. No thought for the future.
	2. Ants are concidered the anti-thesis
		1. Always preparing for tomorrow
		2. Don't take anything for granted
2. Way of Understanding
	1. A lifestyle of seeking the best
		1. By knowing the past and what it caused
		2. Knowing the now and what it will produce in the future
		3. What is in the future
	2. Only one that knows the future truly has understanding
		1. Jesus alone know all the future
		2. From the beginning to the End is His knowledge
		3. Therefore, He alone is the way of understanding
		4. That is why He said: 
			John 14:6: 'Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.'
3. Therefore, We need to forsake the world and seek after the Lord!
