Hebrews 5:11-14

1. Hearing
    1. Isn't just the receiving of sounds upon our ears
        1. You have to act upon what you hear
        2. Otherwise, it's just noise
    2. It implies:
        1. Understanding the words
        2. Acting upon the words
    3. Example:
        1. Yelling "Fire" (ช่วยไฟไหม้!)
        2. Everyone runs for safety
        3. They heard, understood, and took action
        4. Therefore, they heard
2. In this passage, God is saying your dull of hearing
    1. Dull (ขาดความสว่าง) means to retard shininess
        1. We are to reflect Christ's light
        2. but, we restrict (จำกัด) it
        3. Those areas of "restricting" gives opportunities for Satan
            1. He influences our thoughts and decisions
    2. Therefore, dull of hearing is caused by
        1. Partially doing what you hear
        2. Performing the action not with love
        3. Getting someone else to do your job
    3. Once dull already, it is hard to follow God
        1. You quit hearing His voice
        2. And therefore, become more and more dull to God
            1. But, listening to Satan more and more
3. Exercised by use
	1. The clique goes "what you don't use, you loose"
		1. If you stop using you legs to walk, you will not be able to walk after a while
		2. If you stop speaking a language, you soon forget the language
	2. Biblically,  what you don't practice in daily life keeps you from growing
		1. When you read God's Word, listen to preaching, etc
			1. You have to act upon it to grow
				1. Let God's word direct your life, decisions, and directions
				2. Use it to know God's will by surrendering to it
			2. Just reading/hearing it does absolutely nothing in your life
				1. It keeps you from spiritual growth
				2. It keeps you from seeing God working through you life mightily
				3. It makes you to not be able to hear God
					1. That is why so many Christians don't know God's will for their life
	3. When we fail to make use of what we learn, we begin to get cold towards God
		1. Relying on the world's methods and strength
		2. Our love for God waxes cold until we become lukewarm Christians
4. We need to acknowledge our failure to truly listen and get it right with God!
