Matthew 5:23-24 

1. Bring thy gift to the alter
      1. It's any time we are praising God
            - Hebrews 13:15 "By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name."
            - ฮีบรู 13:15 "เหตุฉะนั้น ให้เราถวายคำสรรเสริญเป็นเครื่องบูชาแด่พระเจ้าตลอดไปโดยทางพระองค์นั้น คือผลแห่งริมฝีปากที่ขอบพระคุณพระนามของพระองค์"
                  1. Church
                  2. Prayer
                  3. Witnessing
2. Someone has a fault against you
   1. Any fault you did to someone
   2. It can be something you neglected to do
   3. It can be something they think you did
      1. but you didn't do it
      2. It's anything that comes between you and someone else that you can apologize for.
   4. You can apologize for perceived wrongs
   5. God had you remember it as you came to worship for a reason.
3. Leave your gift and get right
   1. Immediately
      1. It is something that you can not put off to later
   2. You can't properly worship or serve God without getting it right
   3. While holding a grudge you can't know or serve God
   4. You have to have a clear conscience to serve God
      - 1 Timothy 1:19 "Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
      - 1ทิโมธี 1:19 "จงยึดความเชื่อไว้และมีจิตสำนึกอันดี ซึ่งข้อนี้บางคนได้ละทิ้งเสีย ความเชื่อของเขาจึงอับปางลง"
         1. It's not doing wrong to others and God
         2. If wrong was done, confessing it quickly
         3. Make amends of all faults to others and God
         4. Without a clear conscience, we become shipwreck - Not useful like a broken ship
