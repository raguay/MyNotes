Matthew 25:14-30
Luke 19:11-27

1. A ruler was going on a trip
    1. Before going on a trip
	    1. He needed to but people in charge of the kingdom
	    2. They should be faithful
        3. Everyone had a responsibility according to the rulers understanding of the person's ability
            1. The ruler doesn't give the servant work that they are not capable of doing
            2. He is supplying all the means to perform the job.
2. Three servants
    1. Given five talents (ตะลันต์)
        1. traded on the market with the money
        2. Gained five more
        3. The Lord put him in charge of 5 cities
    2. Given two talents (ตะลันต์)
        1. Traded on the market with the money
        2. Gained two more
        3. The Lord put him in charge of 2 cities
    3. Given one talents (ตะลันต์)
        1. Hid the money
            1. He didn't want to chance to lose the money
            2. Lazy, not willing to work to make more money
            3. When you love someone, you will take risks to help or please that person.
        2. Gave one talent back to the lord
            1. And accusing the Lord of dealing deceitfully with others
            2. He didn't love his lord, he just wanted an easy life
            3. Even if he used to love his lord, he now doesn't
        3. In Matthew, Cast him out to utter darkness (Hell)
            1. Unwillingness to serve the master shows a heart that doesn't love
            2. Therefore, most likely still lost and pretending to be a servant
        4. In Luke, give his one talent to the one with ten talents.
            1. What he thought he had was given to one more faithful
            2. He was still in the master's house, but without anything to give
            3. His is the least in heaven
                - Matthew 5:19 'Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.'
                - Matthew 5:19 'เหตุฉะนั้น ผู้ใดได้ทำให้ข้อเล็กน้อยสักข้อหนึ่งในพระบัญญัตินี้เบาลง ทั้งสอนคนอื่นให้ทำอย่างนั้นด้วย ผู้นั้นจะได้ชื่อว่า เป็นผู้น้อยที่สุดในอาณาจักรแห่งสวรรค์ แต่ผู้ใดที่ประพฤติและสอนตามพระบัญญัติ ผู้นั้นจะได้ชื่อว่า เป็นใหญ่ในอาณาจักรแห่งสวรรค์'
3. We should be like the first two servants
    1. Faithful
        - I Corinthians 4:2 'Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.'
        - I Corinthians 4:2 ' ยิ่งกว่านี้ฝ่ายผู้อารักขาเหล่านั้นต้องเป็นคนที่สัตย์ซื่อทุกคน'
          1. We have received salvation from God and are stewards of that salvation.
          2. Therefore, we have to be faithful in all we do 
          3. Not for our sakes, but for Christ's sake!
    2. Not lazy
        - 2 Thessalonians 3:10: 'For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.'
        - 2 Thessalonians 3:10: 'แม้เมื่อเราอยู่กับพวกท่าน เราก็ได้กำชับท่านอย่างนี้ว่า ถ้าผู้ใดไม่ยอมทำงาน ก็อย่าให้เขากิน'
    3. Doing what the Lord wants us to do
4. Not like the third
    1. Either not saved or has allowed their love to wax completely cold.
    2. First shows as laziness and then unfaithfulness
