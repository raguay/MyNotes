Luke 18:1-8

1. God loves us to talk with him
   - 1 Thessalonians 5:17 "Pray without ceasing."
   - 1เธสะโลนิกา 5:17 "จงอธิษฐานอย่างสม่ำเสมอ"
     1. He wants to hear us all the time
     2. He never gets tired of talking with us
     3. He wants us to bring everything to Him in prayer
        1. Desires
        2. Worries
        3. Fears
        4. Dreams
   - 1 Peter 5:7 "Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you."
   - 1เปโตร 5:7 "จงละบรรดาความกระวนกระวายของท่านไว้กับพระองค์ เพราะว่าพระองค์ทรงห่วงใยท่านทั้งหลาย"
2. Not just once
   1. This parable teaching us to keep praying about things without stopping until they are resolved.
   2. This keeps us focused on our needs and realizing that only God can help
   3. Keeps us from trying to do it ourselves if we are really giving it to God each time
   4. It shows God that He's not our last resort, but our whole focus.
3. Question of faith
   1. A lack of faith is shown by how little we pray
   2. When Christ returns
      1. The average Christian will be little in prayer
      2. Almost non-existant in persistent prayer
