Ephesians 3:3-12

1. Here, Paul refers to a mystery (ข้อลึกลับ)
    1. Something that no one knew about
    2. It was hid by God from the beginning until the Gospel was preached
    3. It was fully made know by Paul in this letter to the Ephesians
2. Gentiles and Jews inherit the Kingdom of God together
    1. This is refering to both the millennial kingdom and the new heavens & earth.
    2. Many false teachings exist about this point. Many teach that:
        1. Jews will have the millennial kingdom, but the gentiles will rule during eternity.
        2. The Jews no longer have anything to do with God and have been totally rejected.
        3. There is no millennial kingdom, just the new heavens and earth.
    3. But, these are all false
3. The Ephesian church was mostly Jews
    1. They believed they were superior to the Gentiles
    2. They did not want to believe the Gentiles are their equals
    3. It is an area that Satan was using to destroy the church
        1. There was strife with the few Gentiles in the church
4. But, Gentiles and Jews are the same in Christ Jesus (v. 6, 12)
    1. Fellow heirs (ผู้รับมรดกร่วมกัน)
    2. Same body (อวัยวะของกายอันเดียวกัน)
    3. Partakers of His promise - All of them! (ส่วนได้รับพระสัญญาของพระองค์)
    4. Boldness to come before God (v 12)
    5. Complete access to His love and power (v 12)
5. Paul is declaring this so that Satan will no longer be able to trouble them
    1. When we sin, we give Satan authority to bug us
    2. They were sinning greatly by not including the Gentiles in their church
