Ephesians 3:3-12

1. Here, Paul refers to a mystery (ข้อลึกลับ)
    1. Something that no one knew about
    2. It was hid by God from the beginning until the Gospel was preached
    3. It was fully made know by Paul in his letters to the churches
    4. Many still believe that there are more mysteries of God
        1. But, with the book of Revelation, we know God's Word is Complete
            1. Nothing new to add
            2. All of God's mysteries have been revealed
                1. Except for when Christ will be coming back 
2. Gentiles and Jews inherit the Kingdom of God together
    1. This is refering to both the millennial kingdom and the new heavens & earth.
    2. Many false teachings exist about this point. Many teach that:
        1. Jews will have the millennial kingdom, but the gentiles will rule during eternity.
        2. The Jews no longer have anything to do with God and have been totally rejected.
        3. There is no millennial kingdom, just the new heavens and earth.
        4. and many more strange variants of these themes.
    3. But, these are all false
        1. Satan wants others to feel excluded
        2. It would mean that God wasn't fair
3. The Ephesian church was mostly Jews
    1. They believed they were superior to the Gentiles
    2. They did not want to believe the Gentiles are their equals
    3. It is an area that Satan was using to destroy the church
        1. There was strife with the few Gentiles in the church
        2. The Jews would lord over the gentiles and treat them badly
    4. Just like in the old Testament
        1. Most of Israel would exclude the tribe of Juda in Judges onward
            1. Because of the promises to Juda
            2. They were jealous
4. But, Gentiles and Jews are the same in Christ Jesus (v. 6, 12)
    1. Fellow heirs (ผู้รับมรดกร่วมกัน)
    2. Same body (อวัยวะของกายอันเดียวกัน)
    3. Partakers of His promise - All of them! (ส่วนได้รับพระสัญญาของพระองค์)
    4. Boldness to come before God (v 12)
    5. Complete access to His love and power (v 12)
5. Paul is declaring this so that Satan will no longer be able to trouble them
    1. When we sin, we give Satan rights to bug us - (v 10)
        1. Paul was declaring to them what Satan didn't want them to know.
        2. Paul is also publicly denouncing Satan in this matter
    2. They were sinning greatly by mistreating the Gentiles in their church
