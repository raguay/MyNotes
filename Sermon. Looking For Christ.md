Matthew 2:1-16

1. Wise men looked for Jesus
    1. To Worship
        1. Give Jesus the proper honor and glory
        2. Willing to have a life after Christ
    2. To give all they had
        1. They gave all they had to him: 
            1. gold (ทอง) - King
            2. frankincense (กำยาน) - Priest
            3. myrrh (มดยอบ) - Sacrifice
        2. Each one would take their entire lives to save up for buying
        3. Those three are the most expensive things then
    3. To know God
2. Herod looked for Jesus
    1. To help his position in life
        1. No competing king
        2. He could keep his throne, money, reputation if Jesus is dead
    2. To protect himself from death
        1. When people revolt they kill the current king
        2. But, if no new king is around, then he is safe
    3. But, he didn't really want to know Jesus
        1. He could care less who Jesus was
3. Why are you looking for Jesus?
    1. As the wise men?
        1. to worship, give your all to Him, and follow Him anywhere?
    2. As King Herod?
        2. to protect yourself (good luck charm), escape Hell, or to be popular without really knowing God?
