Acts 14:19-22

1. Paul and Barnabas preaching the Gospel in Lystra
    1. It is the first city that the Bible shows they had some language difficulty
    2. The people saw a miracle and declared that they were Gods
    3. After Jews from Antioch and Iconium came
        1. They did not like Paul and his message
        2. They stirred up the people against them
    4. They stoned Paul to death
        1. They then dragged him out of the city dead
        2. But, as the disciples stood around him
            1. Paul rose up
            2. Went back into the city
    5. Next day, went to Derbe
        1. And then back to Lystra
        2. Confirming the churches and preaching the Gospel.
2. Not even death stopped Paul
    1. He mentions he died in the letter to the Corinthians
        - 2 Corinthians 12:2: 'I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.'
    2. Many would say that's enough and quit
        1. But, Paul didn't quit
        2. He knew his calling was of God and he was following after God
        3. He esteemed God greater than all the problems
    3. Paul suffered many things while following after God
        - 2 Corinthians 11:23-27
            1. Just one of those things would make many quit living for God
            2. His love for Jesus exceeded the pains he had to endure
3. All that to finish well
    - 2 Timothy 4:7: 'I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:'
4. Are we willing to finish well?
