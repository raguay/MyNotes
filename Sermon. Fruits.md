John 15:1-8

1. Churches - v. 1-2 
    1. Churches that don't bare fruit are removed from the branch
        1. They were once in the vine (following Christ)
        2. But, they let busyness distract them away from following Christ.
    2. Jesus is the branch 
        1. It's the same judgement Jesus gives in Revelation
            - Revelation 2:5: 'Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.'
            - วิวน 2:5 'เหตุฉะนั้น จงระลึกถึงสภาพเดิมที่เจ้าได้หล่นจากมาแล้วนั้น จงกลับใจเสียใหม่ และประพฤติตามอย่างเดิม มิฉะนั้นเราจะรีบมาหาเจ้า และจะยกคันประทีปของเจ้าออกจากที่ เว้นไว้แต่เจ้าจะกลับใจใหม่'
                1. The Ephesus church (เอเฟซัส) quit having fruit
                2. Therefore, God will remove their candlestick
                    1. candlestick is God's light and power in their lives
                    2. They cease being a church - they are taken away!
        2. Also, Christians can't loose their salvation
            - Ephesians 4:30: 'And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.'
            - เอเฟซัส 4:30 "และอย่าทำให้พระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์ของพระเจ้าเสียพระทัย เพราะโดยพระวิญญาณนั้นท่านได้ถูกประทับตราหมายท่านไว้จนถึงวันที่ทรงไถ่ให้รอด"
2. Christians - v. 3-8
    1. Christ makes us clean through His Word - v. 3
        1. By faith in His promises
        2. We trust in Him being God of our lives and His work on the cross cleans us of our sins.
    2. Christians are to abide in Christ - v. 4-7
        1. We can't do work for God without it 
        2. We can't have fruit without walking with Christ daily
    3. God is glorified by us changing into His image
        1. Which can only happen as we walk with Him.
3. Fruit 
    1. What is fruit?
        1. Some say it's people we let to God
        2. Others say it's the life changed by Christ
    2. But, the lack of fruit was the problem in the Ephesus church 
        1. They were leading others to Christ
        2. But, they quit walking with Christ
    3. When we walk with Christ 
        1. Others should see us and want to know more
        2. Some will get saved, some won't 
        3. But, our lives do change as we walk with Christ.
    4. The fruit Christ is talking about is a life walking with Him.
        1. Not just sometimes, but all the time.
4. How is your fruit?
