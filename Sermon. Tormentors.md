Matthew 18:21-35

1. Three people
   1. The master of the servants
      1. Represents the Lord Jesus
      2. Everyone owes Jesus a debt of Sin that can not be paid
      3. He has forgiven us all our sins by accepting Him as Lord
   2. An Unforgiving Servant
      1. A person saved by faith through grace
      2. He freely admitted that he owed the debt and that he is unable to ever pay.
         1. He pleads for mercy by grace
      3. The Lord forgives all the debt
         1. Never to bring each individual sin up again
   3. A Indebted Servant
      1. This person owes the Unforgiving servant very little
      2. He cries out for mercy just like the other servant
      3. But, he doesn't receive the mercy
2. Judgment
   1. The Lord judges the Unforgiving servant
      1. being given to tormentors
      2. it isn't hell, it is torments of this life
         1. illnesses
         2. financial difficulties
         3. loss of mental health
         4. etc.
      3. It is a torment for that person and is different for everyone
   2. Saved people often are given to tormentors in this life to learn to forgive others as Jesus has forgiven us.
      1. Others say bad things about us
      2. teasings
      3. theft
      4. direct injuries
      5. holding back something we think we deserve
         1. honor from children
         2. an apology from someone
   3. The same as God forgives us, we must forgive others
      1. unforgiveness leads to bitterness
      2. It is like eating poison to kill the offender
      3. It only hurts yourself
