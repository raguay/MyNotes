Ephesians 2:13-18,22

1. Walls
    1. Used to separate two areas, peoples, etc.
        1. China built a great wall to separate them from their enemies
        2. They felt it would protect them
            1. But, economically and socially, it really hurt them
            2. To now, they still feel separated from the rest of the world
            3. The wall has never come down!
    2. Everyone builds walls
        1. We shut out God by building a wall of sin
            - Isaiah 59:2: 'But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.'
            - อิเสีย 59:2 'แต่ว่าความชั่วช้าของเจ้าทั้งหลายได้กระทำให้เกิดการแยกระหว่างเจ้ากับพระเจ้าของเจ้า และบาปของเจ้าทั้งหลายได้บังพระพักตร์ของพระองค์เสียจากเจ้า พระองค์จึงมิได้ยิน'
                1. Our thoughts and actions of sin keep us from fellowshiping with God
                2. We need to clean it up all the time
        2. We shut out others by building walls around us
            1. Distance between is a wall
            2. Language differences become a wall when both sides don't try to understand each other.
            3. Simply refusing to reach out to others is a wall
                1. Shy people do that to protect themselves from pain
                2. Lonliness is by far a worse pain
        3. We think it protects us, but it hurts us more
2. Jesus has removed the wall
    1. Even though we sin, God is still with us
        1. But, we act like He isn't
            1. We don't talk to Him as much
            2. We don't walk with Him as much
            3. We just go on like nothing ever happened
        2. We create walls in our mind to issolate us from God
            1. We just can't believe God would still love us
    2. We just have to believe it is so
        1. Christ says it in His word, what more do we need!
            1. He loves us with an everlasting love
                - Jeremiah 31:3: 'The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I drawn thee.'
                - เยรามี 31:3 'พระเยโฮวาห์ทรงปรากฏแก่ข้าพเจ้าแต่ก่อน ตรัสว่า ‘เราได้รักเจ้าด้วยความรักนิรันดร์ เพราะฉะนั้นเราจึงชวนเจ้ามาด้วยความเมตตา'
        2. We just admit our faults and trust in His forgiveness
        3. Restoration is easy because Christ tore down the wall
            1. Whatever God destroys isn't rebuildable
            2. He is just waiting on us to come back to Him
        4. And made us one building with God
            1. We are stuck together!
            2. Sealed by the Holy Spirit!
3. Therefore, quit living like your separated
    1. Embrace Jesus everyday with a love that never ends
    2. Walk with Him as He is reaching out to you to do
    3. Show everyone your roommate for life!
