Luke 14:7-14

1. The parable of being invited to a wedding or dinner party
	1. Not a story type parable, but more an instructional parable telling what to do
		1. Jews often invited friends and family for a meal
		2. Especially in the country where they are separated by a good distance usually
	2. So, many were in the habit of inviting guests that they knew would reciprocate
		1. Forming a monthly or so routine with friends and family
		2. Especially around harvest time as everyone would help those around them and then have a meal together
2. Jesus is teaching the right attitude - humility
	1. Wedding
		1. In Jewish manner, wedding meals are spread about in many rooms
			1. No one has a single room to hold a large number of people
			2. To hard and costly to make
		2. Therefore, each room showed the position that person has in the life of the couple
			1. Closest friends and honored guest in the same room with the couple
			2. Each room farther away showed lowering closeness or importance
		3. Jesus is teach not to assume your position is high
			1. Sit in a lower room further away
				1. When the person holding the feast comes by, let him promote you to a higher room
				2. Everyone will wonder what you did to earn the higher location and think highly of you
			2. Otherwise, someone closer or more important to you may show up and force you to take a lower seat
				1. Very humiliating in a Jewish setting - lost face!
	2. Evening Meal
		1. Don't always invite those who will repay you
			1. It not that you should never invite them, just have special times where you invite people that could not pay you back
			2. A way to help the less fortunate people around you
			3. That way, God will repay you for you love and kindness
