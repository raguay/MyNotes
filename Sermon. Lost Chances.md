Numbers 20:8-12

1. Israel complains
    1. They wanted water, again
        1. They chided with Moses that God couldn't provide
        2. All complaints are faithlessness in God's provision
    2. There was a rock there
        1. That rock was Christ
            - 1 Corinthians 10:4 "And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."
            - 1โครินธ์ 10:4 "และได้ดื่มน้ำฝ่ายจิตวิญญาณอันเดียวกันทุกคน เพราะว่าเขาได้ดื่มน้ำซึ่งไหลออกมาจากศิลาฝ่ายจิตวิญญาณที่ติดตามเขามา ศิลานั้นคือพระคริสต์"
    3. God told Moses to speak to the rock
        1. He had to hit it last time
            1. Christ had to die to heal our sin
            2. Just like the rock did nothing wrong, Christ did not deserve it
        2. This time, God wanted him to just speak
            1. After Christ rose again, we just have to ask forgiveness
        3. Speaking to the rock was showing Israel truth about Christ
    4. Moses disobeyed
        1. He struck the rock again
        2. Israel still got the water
        3. But, Moses was disciplined
            1. Lose of reward - couldn't go to the promise land
2. Every disobedience causes a loss of reward
    1. How much have we lost?
    2. Do you want to lose more?
