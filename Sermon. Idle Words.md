Luke 24:1-11

1. The apostles were upset
   1. Their best friend and Lord just died
      1. Peter had declared that only Jesus had the words of life.
         John 6:68 "Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life."
         ยอห์น 6:68 "ซีโมนเปโตรทูลตอบพระองค์ว่า "พระองค์เจ้าข้า พวกข้าพระองค์จะจากไปหาผู้ใดเล่า พระองค์มีถ้อยคำซึ่งให้มีชีวิตนิรันดร์"
      2. Now, he who had the words of life is dead!
   2. Everyone in the city wanted Jesus dead
      1. So, they would like the apostles to be dead too!
      2. Fearful because they shut themselves up
2. Then a strange story
   1. The women came back with tale of
      1. Angels
      2. No corpse
      3. Declaration that Jesus was alive
   2. It seemed to be an idle tale (คำเหลวไหล)
      1. too good to be true
      2. No one ever rose from the dead by themselves!
      3. They felt it was too much to be real
   3. But, then the Lord appears to them
      1. They instantly believe
      2. Following Jesus unto death
      3. Unshakeable, unwavering faith
3. Too many today believe that it is just an idle tale
   1. Heard it so many times
      1. boring
      2. not real anymore
      3. It no longer effects their life
   2. Refuse to believe it's real
      1. because if true, then Jesus is their Lord
      2. They want life their way, not Jesus' way
      3. They want freedom from hell, but life independent of Jesus
   3. If you think it's an idle tale
      1. You might be lost
      2. You might be totally out of God's will
