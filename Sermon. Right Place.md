Mark 14:12-16

1. Simple question
	1. Where shall they eat the passover
		1. They owned nothing, so it had to be a rental
		2. They had nothing to use, so it had to be furnished
		3. So, they had no idea what to do
	2. Jesus' answer
		1. when they go to the city, 
			1. follow a man carrying a water pitcher.
			2. That will be the place to prepare
			3. Instruction were specific and easy to follow
		2. When they did as they were told
			1. It was there! furnished and ready!
2. We have many questions like this in our lives
	1. But, do we ask?
		1. Assuming it's too little to bother God
		2. Not even thinking about God 
      1. Just going on as we normally would. 
	2. Do we ask rightly?
		1. willing to do whatever He says?
			1. If the disciples followed a lady carrying water, they would end up in the wrong place
			2. It would be more common for a lady to be carrying water as that would be the custom.
			3. If they tarried to follow his orders, the man would already be gone.
		2. Believing Him that His way is best?
		3. Do you follow through completely?
			1. If they got distracted and off course, they would still miss God's will.
