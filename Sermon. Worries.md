Luke 12:22-31

1. Our worries
    1. Everyone worries about
        1. Having money for food, house, car, clothes, etc.
            1. Some of it are things we have to have
            2. Some is more than we need, but we would like to have
        2. We have the responsibility to take care of our family
            - 1 Timothy 5:8 "But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
            - 1ทิโมธี 5:8 "แต่ถ้าแม้ผู้ใดไม่เลี้ยงดูวงศ์ญาติของตน และโดยเฉพาะอย่างยิ่งคนในบ้านเรือนของตน ผู้นั้นก็ได้ปฏิเสธความเชื่อเสียแล้ว และชั่วยิ่งกว่าคนที่ไม่ได้เชื่อเสียอีก"
                1. We then worry for their sakes
    2. Worrying comes from realizing we have no control
        1. We can't control what 
            1. the government does or doesn't do
            2. others to do us
            3. the future has in store for us
            4. God want us to do
            5. Our hair, eyes, etc. unchangeable in our lives
        2. We think by worrying about it will change
            1. But, worry just causes more problems and illnesses
2. Jesus is saying that all this worry is for nothing
    1. God didn't create us to control everything
        1. He only gave us a responsibility to take care of things in this world
            - Genesis 2:15 "And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it."
            - ปฐมกาล 2:15 "พระเยโฮวาห์พระเจ้าจึงทรงนำมนุษย์ไปอยู่ในสวนเอเดนให้ดูแลและรักษาสวน"
        2. Trying to control everything is trying to supplant God in our lives
            1. That is when worrying starts to control our lives and ruin it.
    2. God created everything to serve Him
        1. the grass serves God by it's beauty and food for animals
        2. The animals serve God according to how God created them
        3. People are the only things in the universe that doesn't!
    3. As we walk with God
        1. God promises to take care of everything we can't control
        2. But, walking with God never means we do nothing
            - 2 Thessalonians 3:10 "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
            - 2เธสะโลนิกา 3:10 "แม้เมื่อเราอยู่กับพวกท่าน เราก็ได้กำชับท่านอย่างนี้ว่า ถ้าผู้ใดไม่ยอมทำงาน ก็อย่าให้เขากิน"
                1. We do work to provide for self and family
                    1. As long as we don't compromise what God wants, our work will provide for everything
                    2. If not, we aren't walking with God correctly
                2. Then we work to do what God wants
        3. We have to be willing to do the work God directs us to
            1. Too many believe that everything would have to change
            2. But, that isn't true. In the first church, everyone helped according to the direction from God. They still had their normal lives.
