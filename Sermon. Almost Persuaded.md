Acts 26:26-29

1. The argument
	1. Paul used his own testimony
		1. Showing that Jesus is God by him being the voice from heaven
		2. Showing Paul has been faithful and God has greatly protected and used him.
	2. Paul asks Agrippa the critical question
		1. "Do you believe?"
			1. You are a sinner.
			2. You are doomed to eternity in hell
			3. Your only hope is Jesus Christ
				1. Jesus is the only God
				2. He paid the penalty for every sin you ever commit
				3. A willingness to follow after Jesus
		2. Though most everyone will
			1. Agree to the first point
			2. Some will agree there is a judgement
			3. But not many will accept that Jesus is the only Way
			4. Looking for other ways
				1. To Keep what they are already have or are doing
				2. To please others
				3. Not to cause problems
	3. Agrippa's sad response
		1. "Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."
			1. Almost (เกือบ) = Something is holding him back
				1. Friends or Family or society
				2. Position
				3. Personal Desires
		2. As far as we know, he never did trust in Christ​.
			1. Therefore, he is now in Hell.
3. Almost persuaded
	1. Non-Christians
		1. Almost is the same as not
			1. 99% trusting means 0% saved!
		2. God does not have to give more time or chances
			1. But, thank God He does
		3. Putting off once and the next time is harder
			1. The heart of man quits accepting truth
			2. The Spirit of God will quit trying
				- Genesis 6:3 "And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh..."
				- Genesis 6:3 "พระเยโฮวาห์ตรัสว่า “วิญญาณของเราจะไม่วิงวอนกับมนุษย์ตลอดไป เพราะเขาเป็นแต่เนื้อหนัง...”"
		4. Trying to be a secret Christian
			- Matthew 10:33: 'But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven.'
			- มัทธิว 10:33 'แต่ผู้ใดจะปฏิเสธเราต่อหน้ามนุษย์ เราจะปฏิเสธผู้นั้นต่อพระพักตร์พระบิดาของเราผู้ทรงสถิตในสวรรค์ด้วย'
				1. Go to church, but never tell anyone outside of church that they believe.
				2. Just going to church means nothing
					1. It's like going to the bank
					2. It helps in this life, but doesn't get you to heaven
		5. Once you die without Christ
			1. Eternal life in hell
			2. There is no second chance
	2. Christians
		1. Everyday, we have to decide to follow Jesus
			1. Once to get to heaven
			2. Everyday to get the benefits of knowing Jesus
		2. Almost Persuaded to
			1. Study God's Word
				1. No knowledge to help others
				2. No guidance through life
			2. Pray
				1. No power of God
				2. No direction for life
				3. No peace
			3. Live as Christ
				1. No one trusting in the Lord because of your life
				2. Just seem like everyone else
			4. Serve the Lord
				1. No wages in this life
				2. No rewards in heaven
4. Almost Persuaded is the saddest thing​
	1. In the judgment​
		1. almost will not help you
		2. You will see others who did trust in Christ​ safe with Jesus.
	2. In Christian life
		1. Almost makes a miserable life​
			1. Because God will discipline you
