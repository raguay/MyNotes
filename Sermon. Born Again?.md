John 3:1-21

1. Jesus has a visitor
    1. Nicodemus
        1. A Pharisee
            1. a very religious person
            2. Memorized the first 5 books, Psalms, Proverbs, and all the prophetic books of the Old Testament
                1. Also all 1500 extra laws they came up with to keep God's 10 commandments
            3. They prayed three times a day for an hour no matter where they were
                1. All form prayers
                2. Nothing from the heart
            4. They fasted from 6:00pm to 5:59 pm the next day twice a week
            5. Never missed a service in the Temple or Synagogue
            6. They tithe 10% of everything, not just money
                1. anything they grew or was given to them
        2. But, he was lost
            1. He could not follow anything Jesus said that was spiritual
                1. He did not understand the new birth (3-7)
                2. He did not understand following God (8)
2. Jesus was confused that a highly religious person could not grasp the things of God (10-13)
    1. So He starts at the beginning to help him understand
        1. God must help us to be saved (14-15)
            1. Jesus must die on the cross
            2. He takes our punishment for our sins
            3. If we get what we deserve
                1. We would have to spend eternity in Hell for just one sin
                2. But, we are continually sinning
        2. God does this because He loves us (16-18)
            1. God doesn't want to condemn us, but help us
            2. Everyone is condemned already by our own sin
                1. We are just waiting for the judgement to get the full penalty
                2. We just get "tastes" of our punishment now: illnesses, pain, suffering
        3. Man can't do it because he hates God (19-21)
            1. No one seeks after God on their own
            2. Because we like being our own boss
                1. Have you ever gone looking for someone to command you around?
                2. Or, do you hide from them?
            3. We always want to think good of ourselves
                1. Even people that try to commit suicide think they are good - the act will help others.
3. We have to humble ourselves and accept God's gift
    1. We are just sinners
        1. Unable to work our way to heaven
        2. Totally unable to please God with our own works
        3. We just sin!
    2. Jesus is God - He that has all rights to our lives
        1. He made us
        2. He died for us
        3. Our lives are not our own!
            - 1 Corinthians 6:20 "For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."
            - 1โครินธ์ 6:20 "พระเจ้าได้ทรงซื้อท่านไว้แล้วตามราคา เหตุฉะนั้นท่านจงถวายพระเกียรติแด่พระเจ้าด้วยร่างกายของท่าน และด้วยจิตวิญญาณของท่าน ซึ่งเป็นของพระเจ้า"
    3. If we acknowledge this fact with not just our mouth, but our lives
        1. God will give us a new birth
        2. A mental acknowledgement of a fact is just that
            1. It changes nothing about our decisions and life
            2. It's just another fact stored in our minds 
            3. That is the Pharisee's problem
        3. A heart felt belief will change what we do
            1. When it's from the heart, we want to follow after Christ
            2. Christ never asked anyone to say they believed, but to follow after Him
4. Are you a Pharisee trying to do good, or a Christians walking with Christ?
    1. The Pharisees were condemned to Hell because they were their own boss
        - Matthew 23:33 "Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?"
        - มัทธิว 23:33 "เจ้าพวกงู เจ้าชาติงูร้าย เจ้าจะพ้นการลงโทษในนรกอย่างไรได้"
    2. Christians go to heaven because we are walking with Christ
        1. They have a loving relationship with God
