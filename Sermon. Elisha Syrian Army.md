2 Kings 6:8-23

1. Syrian Kings wants to capture Elisha
	1. Because he is telling the Israel king everything they were doing
	2. Israel was able to avoid them three times.
	3. They found out where Elisha is and sent the army there to get him.
2. Elisha and his helper gets up in the morning
	1. The helper sees only the army around the city
		1. He isn't spiritually mature enough to see by faith
		2. He still walks by his sight and not by faith
	2. Elisha's helper thinks it takes a physical army to defeat the Syrians
3. Elisha declares that there are more on our side than their side
	1. Of course, Elisha is speaking about the spiritual aspect
4. Elisha prays for God to open his eyes
	1. Elisha's helper then could see the company of angels all around the city
	2. Much more than the Syrian army
	3. God grants the prayer because:
		1. His faithful servant walking close to God asked
		2. It was just showing the work God is already doing
			1. It really wasn't a new thing at all
		3. It is about wisdom that God promises to give (James 1:5-7)
5. Elisha prays for God to "smite them with blindness"
	1. This isn't total blindness
		1. But a masking of identity
		2. It doesn't really hurt anyone, just keeps Elisha's identity and their general location hidden from them.
	2. Elisha leads them to Samaria
		1. To show the king the work that God is doing
			1. Trying to help the king to learn to follow God
		2. Show the Syrian army that they have no power over God's servant
			1. It really taught the Syrian king to respect the man of God
6. Elisha prays for their eyes to be opened
	1. Once again, they knew where they were and who everyone is
7. The king wanted to kill them
	1. But, God wants his work declared to others so that they would learn of Him.
	2. Elisha tells the king to feed and help them get home safe so that they can declare the works of God
8. Elisha's prayers
	1. All were according to God's will and plans
	2. All were to declare to the world who God is and his mighty power and grace!
		1. None of the soldiers should of lived
		2. They evading their country as an act of war
		3. But, God wanted them to receive mercy.
