John 13:4-17

1. Jesus teaching about servanthood
	1. After finishing eating his last supper with them, He striped to just a towel
	2. He washed each of the disciples feet
		1. They were all washed already before coming to the meal
		2. But, their feet were dirty from walking to the upper room
	3. Then he dressed himself and explained
		1. He, being the master, served each of them the lowest job in the time period
			1. It was considered the job of a slave
			2. No rabbi or non-slave would consider to wash someone else's feet
		2. He told them to do likewise
			1. Not commanded to wash everyone's feet to get to heaven
			2. But, serve everyone around them with a cheerful heart
	4. The last statement is the shocker
		1. Those that do this will be happy!
		2. True joy and peace comes when we serve others
2. We are to serve others and not expect them to serve us
	1. Dorcas was a great example
		- Acts 9:39 "Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them."
		- กิจการ 9:39 "ฝ่ายเปโตรจึงลุกขึ้นไปกับเขา เมื่อถึงแล้วเขาพาท่านขึ้นไปในห้องชั้นบน และบรรดาหญิงม่ายได้ยืนอยู่กับท่านพากันร้องไห้และชี้ให้ท่านดูเสื้อคลุมกับเสื้อผ้าต่างๆซึ่งโดรคัสทำเมื่อยังมีชีวิตอยู่"
			1. Her servant spirit by making things for everyone was the testimony everyone offered to Peter upon her death
			2. God saw fit to allow her to revive to keep it up!
	2. We are to serve everyone around us (in and out of church) in the same way
		- Luke 22:26 "But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve."
		- ลูกา 22:26 "แต่พวกท่านจะหาเป็นอย่างนั้นไม่ ผู้ใดในพวกท่านที่เป็นใหญ่ที่สุด ให้ผู้นั้นเป็นเหมือนผู้เล็กน้อยที่สุด และผู้ใดเป็นนาย ให้ผู้นั้นเป็นเหมือนคนรับใช้"
			1. In God's eyes, greatness is measured by our servanthood
			2. Always trying to get it our way (a master) puts us on the bottom of God's servants
3. How can:
	1. We serve those in our own homes?
	2. We serve others?
	3. Our church serve the community?
