Exodus 31:2-11

1. God calls Moses to build the Ark of the Covenant and the Tent of Meeting
	1. That is a lot of items to build​
		1. 15 different big items
		2. Many of them had smaller parts that was to be built as well
	2. But, God knows Moses can't do it
		1. He prepares the heart of others to help
			1. Two people lead the work
				1. They had the most knowledge​ and skills​.
				2. Not only could they do the work, but they were able to teach others​.
			2. Many others to help out
				1. Less skilled in the work
				2. But just as willing to work
		2. The skills they have didn't just happen overnight
			1. God has been shaping their lives for years for this time
	3. As everyone works together 
		1. The work gets done.
		2. They are very successful​ in the work.
	4. All the while, God provided the things they needed
			1. Food
			2. Building materials​ from spoiling Egypt​ when they left.
2. God also does the same for us
	- 1 Thessalonians 5:24 "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."
	- 1 เธสะโลนิกา 5:24 "พระองค์ผู้ทรงเรียกท่านนั้นสัตย์ซื่อ และพระองค์จะทรงทำให้สำเร็จ"
		1. First, God is calling everyone to salvation
			1. They don't want God before God starts working in their hearts.
			2. As God works in their hearts as they hear and see the Gospel from a Christian
				1. They begin to understand the truth and get saved.
				2. It is God working in their hearts​ to know Him.
		2. Then God is calling us to work
			1. First, we need to be faithful in the small things​
				1. Especially reaching others with the Gospel
				2. The bible study, prayer, and faithful church attendance leads us to be a witness.
			2. Then God calls us to the bigger things​.
				1. The bigger things will be different for each person.
				2. But, all work for God leads to witnessing to others
			3. It is a work that God has been preparing us to do.
				1. We never recognize it at the time
				2. But, when we start working with God is when we see what God has been doing.
			4. Those that don't work will have problems​
				- 2 Thessalonians 3:10 "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
				- 2 เธสะโลนิกา 3:10 "แม้เมื่อเราอยู่กับพวกท่าน เราก็ได้กำชับท่านอย่างนี้ว่า ถ้าผู้ใดไม่ยอมทำงาน ก็อย่าให้เขากิน"
					1. This means our normal work and God's work​
					2. Only faithful workers are guaranteed to be fed​.
						- Matthew 6:33 "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you."
						- มัทธิว 6:33 "แต่ท่านทั้งหลายจงแสวงหาอาณาจักรของพระเจ้า และความชอบธรรมของพระองค์ก่อน แล้วพระองค์จะทรงเพิ่มเติมสิ่งทั้งปวงเหล่านี้ให้แก่ท่าน"
		3. If every Christian is a faithful worker
			1. There will be more 
				1. people saved​
				2. churches started
			2. All the work God wants done would get done​!
				1. This world would be a far better place.
3. Are you performing the work God has prepared you to do?
	1. If not, why not?
		1. No one else is isn't a valid reason.
		2. Someone has to be an example, why not you?
	2. God has people only you can reach with the Gospel.
		1. Don't you care?
