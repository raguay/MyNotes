# 2023 Presentation

1. We would like to have started other churches by now
    1. But, we are still trying to get our first church on it's own feet.
2. We witness in public schools
    1. Around 220 public school kids hear a Sunday School type Bible lesson every week.
        1. 50 kids come to a full service we have on Sundays in a boarding school for low income families from areas without good schools
    2. Many kids are interested, but scared due to lost parents
        1. Rak has a muslem mom, buddhist dad
3. Since Covid is less of an issue
    1. More members are helping in tracts distribution
    2. More people have been interested in English classes and church 
4. Last several months we have been handing out John/Romans with our tracts
    1. Bia got a John/Romans at his home, read it, came to church asking for a Bible, and read a large amount of it
    2. He trusted in Jesus just before we left on this trip!
5. We need more workers in the church
    1. few men are interested in Jesus due to working and alchohol
    2. Young men are expected to become monks for a time period to help their parents go to "heaven"
