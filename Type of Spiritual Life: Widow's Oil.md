2 Kings 4:1-7

1. A widow
    1. Husband, a prophet, died with a huge debt
        1. They could not pay off the debt at all
        2. The widow had no income and the sons were doing their best
    2. The collector was coming to make her two sons bondsmen
        1. If someone couldn't pay, the collector would take her sons
        2. She would never see them again!
    3. All she had was a pot of oil
        1. Most likely already sold everything else of value
        2. This was used in making food and in that culture very important to have enough.
    4. Elijah told her to collect all the empty vessels she could from friends
        1. 'Not a few' was the warning
    5. The pot of oil filled all the vessels that she and her sons borrowed
    6. Elijah told her to sell the oil, pay the debts, and live on the rest
2. Spirit Filled Life
    1. We have a great debt of sin
        1. We can't pay it off or cleanse ourselves
        2. We have to acknowledge this always
    2. Death would cause us to pay off the debt
        1. An eternity in Hell
    3. The pot of oil
        1. In the Bible, oil represents the Holy Spirit
        2. All we have is the Holy Spirit to protect us
            1. Salvation saves us from sin and death
            2. Christ paid the debt in our place
        3. But, we still sin and have problems
            1. The only help we need is in the Holy Spirit leading our life
    4. Collect other vessels
        1. Represents the Christian homework we are to do
            1. Study the Bible
            2. Praying without ceasing
            3. Witnessing
            4. Faithful church attendance
            5. Any special job God calls us to do
    5. The more we do, the more vessels we have to be filled
        - Ephesians 5:18 "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
        - เอเฟซัส 5:18 "จงประกอบด้วยพระวิญญาณและอย่าเมาเหล้าองุ่นซึ่งจะทำให้เสียคน แต่จงประกอบด้วยพระวิญญาณ"
            1. We are not to have 'a few'
            2. Do as much as we can and we will have abundance of the Holy Spirit in our lives
            3. As we work with God, His Spirit fills our lives and work
                1. Plenty of help!
    6. We will then have more than enough of the Holy Spirit to lead our lives and help in the time of need.
        - Hebrews 4:16 "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need."
        - ฮีบรู 4:16 "ฉะนั้นขอให้เราทั้งหลายจงมีใจกล้าเข้ามาถึงพระที่นั่งแห่งพระคุณ เพื่อเราจะได้รับพระเมตตา และจะได้พบพระคุณที่จะช่วยเราในขณะที่ต้องการ"
            1. Not being faithful causes us to not think to go to God with everything.
            2. But, the more 'vessels' we have filled, the quicker we think to go to God with everything.
