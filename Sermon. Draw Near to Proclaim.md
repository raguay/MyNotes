Psalms 73:27-28 "For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee. But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works."

สดุดี 73:27-28 "เพราะดูเถิด บุคคลผู้ห่างเหินจากพระองค์จะพินาศ พระองค์ทรงให้บุคคลที่ไม่จริงต่อพระองค์ดับไป แต่ส่วนข้าพระองค์ ที่จะเข้าใกล้พระเจ้านั้นดี ข้าพระองค์ได้วางใจในองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าพระเจ้า เพื่อข้าพระองค์จะได้เล่าถึงพระราชกิจทั้งสิ้นของพระองค์"

1. This Psalms is about a Christian slipping from God
    1. He sees the ungodly being prosperous and not having problems
        1. Just the normal issues dealing with others and this world
        2. He doesn't see God judging them
    2. He becomes envious of them
        1. Because God disciples him when he strays
        2. They all seem to have life easier than he does
        3. He feels like he should have more than the ungodly in this world
2. End of those that turn away from God
    1. Worship things made by man's hands
        1. Statues 
        2. Money
        3. Position
        4. Friends, family, nation
    2. Have no desire to be close to God daily
        1. They actually flee from God when others aren't looking
        2. They are not interested in what God does or wants them to do.
        3. They really do not want what God has for them in life.
    3. Even though some try to look like they are following God
        1. They reject Him on average days
    4. Their end is what they want
        1. Eternal separation from God
        2. But, that means in Hell and not in Heaven!
3. Those that draw near to God
    1. They daily show a love for God
    2. They trust whatever God's will is for them
        1. They will have more in Heaven
        2. This world is less important than heaven to the godly
    3. For a Purpose
        1. To declare all His works
