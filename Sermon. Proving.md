Ephesians 5:8-11

1. When we trust in Jesus alone
    1. We become "light": Children of God
        1. We desire to do what God sees as right
        2. We want to please the Lord when we get saved
            1. Because He's my daddy now!
    2. Though we used to be "darkness": Children of the Devil
        1. It takes contious effort to not walk as we used to
            1. Things we just did as children/teenagers/young adults that we never thought about weather it was right or wrong
            2. Just because we used to do it and others do do it doesn't mean it's right and okay
            3. Other Christians do it because they don't want to think it's wrong doesn't make it right either.
        2. We need to analize what we used to do and see what is wrong according to God and His word
            1. That means to study His Word
            2. It means to ask Jesus, "What do you want me to do!"
            3. And then do what Jesus says is right
                1. Not your friends, family, or culture
2. Therefore, we need to prove what is acceptable to God
    1. Not by experimenting with it - way too dangerous
    2. But, by reading God's Word
        1. God says "have no fellowship with darkness"
            1. Do not participate in any form or fashion
        2. We should reprove it
            1. Not by arguing about it
            2. But, by not doing it and openly telling why you will not do it
    3. If we make excuses, we already know it's wrong.
3. Instead, you need to flee
    - 1 Corinthians 10:14: 'Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.'
    - 1 โครินธ์ 10:14 "พวกที่รักของข้าพเจ้า เหตุฉะนั้นท่านจงหลีกเลี่ยงเสียจากการนับถือรูปเคารพ"
    - I Thessalonians 5:22 "Abstain from all appearance of evil."
    - I เธสะโลนิกา 5:22 "จงเว้นเสียจากสิ่งที่ดูเหมือนชั่วทุกอย่าง"
        1. Idolatry is anything contrary to God
        2. It is putting other things before serving Jesus Christ
            1. Willing to participate in activities for other gods instead of Jesus
                1. Floating boats to get rid of your sins is idolatry
                2. If you participate at all, you are sinning
            2. Willing to give to monks for your job
                1. Job is your God causing you to commit Idolatry
4. Are you going to walk as Children of Light or darkness?
