Mark 16:15 ”And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.“

1. Jesus commands all Christians to reach the lost world 
	1. Locally
	2. Globally
2. When people think about missions
	1. Many think that they could never do it
		1. Learning a new language is hard
		2. Dealing with a different culture is hard
		3. Changing environments is hard
	2. The fear of those things keep them from ever considering to follow God
	3. God wants us to be willing to do anything He asks us to do
3. But, we should be thinking about what can God do
	- 1 Thessalonians 5:24 ”Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.“
		1. God enables us to do His will
			1. We simply have to be willing
		2. He takes our weaknesses and empowers us
			- 1 Corinthians 1:27 ”but God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;“
					1. By using those that can’t do it, God will get all the glory
		3. Whatever God calls us to do, He will help us to do it
4. God can
	1. Supply all our needs
		- Philippians 4:19 ”But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.“
	2. Comfort you when things get hard
		- 2 Corinthians 1:3 ”Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;“
	3.  Strengthens you when you don’t think you can do it
		- Isaiah 41:10 ”Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.“
	4. Empowers you 
		- 2 Timothy 1:7 ”For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.“
