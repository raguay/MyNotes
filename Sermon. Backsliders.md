Hebrews 12:14-17

1. We are to live peacefully with all men
    1. This isn't a requirement, but what we should strive toward.
    2. As we follow God, He helps us to have peace
        1. But some will not as they hate God they see in us!
2. Or, we will backslide
    1. Most conflicts we experience isn't due to following God
        1. But, a result of doing things our own way
        2. God doesn't help us get along with others at this point
    2. "fail of the grace of God" - v. 15
        1. This isn't loosing one's salvation
            1. But us not accepting God's power to live for Him
        2. It is failing to obtain God's grace to follow Him
            - Jeremiah 8:5 "Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return."
            - เยเรมีย์ 8:5 "ทำไมชาวเยรูซาเล็มนี้จึงได้หันไป เป็นการกลับสัตย์อยู่เป็นนิตย์ เขายึดการหลอกลวงไว้มั่น เขาทั้งหลายปฏิเสธไม่ยอมกลับ"
                1. God gave grace to Israel to follow Him
                2. God was tired of Jerusalem's constantly turning away from Him and rejecting His grace.
                3. They didn't want God as king, but just someone to help them get out of trouble they get themselves into.
    3. God calls it backsliding and that is what Christians do when
        1. They deny God's right to lead their lives
        2. They followed other things instead of God
        3. Too busy to look to God for direction
        4. Using God instead of serving God
    4. When we refuse to get right with God
        1. God eventually quits reminding us
            - Proverbs 14:14 "The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself."
            - สุภาษิต 14:14 "คนที่มีใจหันกลับจะได้ผลจากทางของเขาจนเต็ม และคนดีก็จะได้ผลดีแห่งการกระทำของเขา"
                1. We live on with our own ways and not God's way
                2. Our lives will be filled with the problems that it creates
        2. Then we have to realize ourselves and get right without God's prompting
            1. Not easy as we forget and get used to God not talking to us
3. We simply have to repent and ask for God's forgiveness    
    1. But, it has to be the right way
        1. Sorry for not letting God lead and direct us
            1. Proper sorrow is being sorry for offending God
            2. God wants to be first in our lives, not last!
        2. Sorry for the punishment given isn't repentance
            1. Verses 4-11 tell that God will discipline His children
            2. If we don't get disciplined for not following God
                1. Then we aren't his children - v. 8
            3. We have to repent of the wrong, not for the pain of discipline
    2. God uses Esau as an example - v. 16-17
        1. He sold his birth right to Jacob
            1. The birthright was God coming into the world by Abraham
            2. It really wasn't his to give away
            3. He willingness to give it up shows his rejection of God
        2. When he couldn't get the blessing
            1. He cried for the lost blessing
            2. He didn't see selling his birthright (rejecting God) was wrong
            3. He never came to repentance
                1. Though others would think he repented by his tears
                2. God looks at the attitude of the heart and not the tears
