John 10:1-18

1. The shepherd goes into the sheep fold by the door
	1. He goes the proper way
	2. The sheep hear and know His voice
	3. The sheep will only follow the true shepherd.
2. Robbers and Killers go over the wall
	1. Looking for ways to get to the sheep their way
		1. They never want to follow Jesus
		2. They will use "Christian" vocabulary and positions for their own desires
		3. They don't have to be pastors.
			1. Church members that don't want to follow Jesus will "scatter" the others.
3. They just scatter (ทำให้ฝูงแกะกระจัดกระจายไป) and kill the sheep
    - Luke 11:23 "He that is not with me is against me: and he that gathereth not with me scattereth."
    - ลูกา 11:23 "ผู้ที่ไม่อยู่ฝ่ายเราก็เป็นปฏิปักษ์ต่อเรา และผู้ที่ไม่รวบรวมไว้กับเราก็เป็นผู้กระทำให้กระจัดกระจายไป"
    	1. If we aren't walking with Jesus, we are scattering the sheep!
	    	1. We can witness, but the effect is scattering them if we aren't walking with Jesus.
    	2. If they don't get saved, they die as though we killed them.
	    	1. Because Jesus gave the commandment to reach them!
	    	2. We are responsible for our actions.
4. Jesus is the shepherd of the sheep and the door of the sheep fold
	1. Sheep are saved people
	2. People can only enter the sheep fold by trusting in Jesus
		1. Nothing to do with rituals, churches, money given, or what we do
		2. It's only by entering through Jesus
        	- John 14:6 "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
        	- ยอห์น 14:6 "พระเยซูตรัสกับเขาว่า "เราเป็นทางนั้น เป็นความจริง และเป็นชีวิต ไม่มีผู้ใดมาถึงพระบิดาได้นอกจากมาทางเรา"
	        	1. It is Jesus' way or no way.
	3. Hirelings are local pastors that Jesus uses to watch over the sheep
		1. Hirelings aren't bad, but they also don't love as Jesus loves us
		2. Some worry over popularity more than walking with God.
			1. Then they start scattering the sheep.
	4. Even if the local pastor leaves the sheep, Jesus never will
		1. We need to be looking to the Great Shepherd always to lead us
		2. Pray for the local pastor to stay close to the shepherd as well
5. Christ has other sheep not of "this fold"
	1. "this fold" speaking about the Jews
	2. He has others, Jesus is telling that the Gospel is for everyone
		1. He will be bringing in the others nations as well
		2. Everyone who believes in Jesus will be one fold (or group)
6. Jesus declare that no one can kill Him
	3. He willingly gives His life
	4. No one can take Jesus' life from Him
		1. If he didn't give His life, He would hang on the cross suffering forever!
	5. The Father gives Jesus this power
		1. While on the earth, Jesus' direct power was limited by the Father
			1. That is why he prayed to the Father continuously.
		2. But, this was the whole reason for Jesus to be born a man and God.
			1. To pay the penalty for all of our sins!
7. Are you trying to get to Heaven the right way?
	6. Only by faith in Jesus Christ.
	7. Or, trusting in your "religiousness" (ความเคร่งศาสนา)
