Jonah 1-4

1. A prophet of God
    - 2 Kings 14:25 "He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher."
    - 2พงศ์กษัตริย์ 14:25 "พระองค์ทรงตีเอาดินแดนอิสราเอลคืนมาตั้งแต่ทางเข้าเมืองฮามัทไกลไปจนถึงทะเลแห่งที่ราบ ตามพระวจนะของพระเยโฮวาห์พระเจ้าแห่งอิสราเอล ซึ่งพระองค์ตรัสโดยผู้รับใช้ของพระองค์คือโยนาห์ ผู้เป็นบุตรชายอามิททัย ผู้พยากรณ์ผู้มาจากกัธเฮเฟอร์"

        2. The Pharisees were wrong in saying there isn't a prophet from that area
            1. Jesus even told them as "...Jonah was in the whale..."
            2. If they would just listen they would of known the truth
2. God told him to tell Ninava that He was going to destroy them for their sins.

    2. A point furtherest away from Ninavah

8. Jonah mad and God teaches him with a gord
    1. Jonah is mad and storms out of the city to wait for God's judgement
    2. God causes a gord plant to grow and cover Jonah

    3. God then kills the plant and sends a hot south wind
        1. Jonah gets madder

        1. 120,000 people that don't know left hand from right hand

        3. Those children should not have to die for their parents' sin
