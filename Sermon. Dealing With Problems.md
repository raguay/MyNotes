1 Samuel 30:6-8

1. David and his men went to fight with the Philistines
	1. Israel
		1. God's judgment was upon Israel because of Saul
			1. God's plan for Saul to die in this battle
				1. Saul refused to let David be king
					1. Saul tried to kill David
			2. Saul also used a witch to call up Samuel
				1. Christians shouldn't use the world's solutions
				2. Saul is a Christian because he died and went to where Samuel was
					- 1 Samuel 28:19 "Moreover the LORD will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the Philistines: and to morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the LORD also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines."
					- 1ซามูเอล 28:19 "ยิ่งกว่านั้นอีกพระเยโฮวาห์จะทรงมอบอิสราเอลพร้อมกับตัวท่านไว้ในมือของคนฟีลิสเตีย พรุ่งนี้ตัวท่านพร้อมกับบุตรชายทั้งหลายของท่านจะอยู่กับเรา และพระเยโฮวาห์จะทรงมอบกองทัพอิสราเอลไว้ในมือของคนฟีลิสเตียด้วย""
	2. But, the Lords of the Philistines refused David's help
		1. They sent him back home
		2. He pretended to be offended and left for Ziklag - his home in exile
2. Ziklag was destroyed
	1. All the women and children taken captive
	2. All the belongings stolen
	3. The houses burned
	4. Nothing was left when David and his men got there
3. David's men plotted to kill David
	1. It was his fault the city was destroyed
    	1. He brought them out of Israel and settled in a city of the Philistines
	2. They knew they would not be fighting Israel
		1. So, why leave their houses unprotected?
4. David prays 
	1. First, encouraging his heart in God
		1. Singing a spiritual song
		2. Thinking about all that God has done for him
		3. Remembering God's promises
    		1. God promised to always be with him
        		1. It's Gods promise to all that follow Him
    		2. He would be king in Israel
	2. Then he asked God for direction
		1. Chase after them?
		2. God said yes and that he would recover all
5. So, encouraged in the Lord and His promises, David and most of his men chases after the foe
	1. They did recover all because of what David did!
    	1. Only their houses were lost
    	2. But, they were moving to Hebron in Israel in a few days
        	1. While they were recovering their stuff
            	1. Israel was defeated by the Philistines
            	2. Saul and his sons were killed in the battle
6. When we face problems
	1. Don't
		1. Complain, look for someone to blame, take it out on others, etc. - David's men
		2. Seek methods of the world - Saul
	2. Do
		1. Encourage yourself in the Lord
		2. Seek God's direction to resolve the issue
			1. At least receive strength from God to bear it all
	3. Purpose to seek God more when there isn't a problem
		1. Many of our problems happen because we weren't properly listening to God.
