Romans 14:1-6 

1. Doubtful Disputations (โต้เถียงกันในเรื่องความเชื่อที่แตกต่างกันนั้น)
    1. This means areas that the Bible doesn't have a clear answer
        1. Examples that have clear answers
            1. Smoking, drinking alcohol 
                1. Modern science clearly shows that these cause permanent damage to vital organ in your body
                2. Doing them too much will eventually kill you
                3. 'Thou shalt not kill'
            2. Playing violent video games that shows people dying
                1. "Thou shalt not kill"
                    - Romans 1:32 "Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."
                    - โรม 1:32 "แม้เขาจะรู้การพิพากษาของพระเจ้าที่ว่าคนทั้งปวงที่ประพฤติเช่นนั้นสมควรจะตาย เขาก็ไม่เพียงประพฤติเท่านั้น แต่ยังเห็นดีกับคนอื่นที่ประพฤติเช่นนั้นด้วย"
        2. Not so clear
            1. Valentine's Day
                1. Even though it has roots in the Greek Goddess of love - Venus
                2. Nothing in the Bible would say don't celebrate love
                    1. As long as it is true love in a marriage setting
                    2. Illicit sex is always a sin - which the original celebration was.
            2. Christmas
                1. Was illegal many years in the US and other countries
                    1. Due to just a Roman Catholic replacement for the celebration of the god of the Dead.
                2. Modern days it has lost all the former meanings
                    1. Most people around the world sees it as a celebration of Jesus' birth - Christians and others
                    2. Even though he could not of been born in the winter
                    3. Since shepherds where outside, it was most likely late summer
                        1. Shepherds stay indoors during the winter
2. We are to accept those who don't and do things that aren't clear in the Bible
    1. One side should not look down on the other
    2. Both parties do or don't do it unto Jesus
        1. If they make the observance an issue of salvation, they are clearly wrong from the Bible!
        2. Salvation is by faith, not observing a day, performing an ritual, etc.
    3. It's up to Jesus to correct these things
        1. Convict the person that they shouldn't do it
            1. If you have to ask someone else if it's okay, your heart is already telling you not to
            2. God's Spirit speaks to us in our hearts warning us
        2. Making them uncomfortable with their decisions
            1. Guilt comes when we do wrong and refuse to acknowledge wrong to God
            2. Satan then makes the guilt even worse if he knows you will not respond properly to God
        3. Only the master can correct the servant in matters that can not be clearly understood from the scriptures.
3. But, if you aren't sure you should or shouldn't do something, then don't
    1. Your not fully convinced in your own mind
        1. We doubt things we feel like we shouldn't do, but we want to
        2. Some times the doubt is from God
        3. Some times it's just our own fears
        4. And, sometimes it's Satan getting us down
    2. What isn't of faith is sin
        - Romans 14:23 "And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin."
        - โรม 14:23 "แต่ผู้ที่ยังสงสัยอยู่นั้น ถ้าเขากินก็จะถูกลงพระอาชญา เพราะเขามิได้กินด้วยความเชื่อ ทั้งนี้เพราะการกระทำใดๆก็ตามที่มิได้กระทำด้วยความเชื่อก็เป็นบาปทั้งสิ้น"
