Exodus 24:3 "And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, **All the words which the LORD hath said will we do.**"

อพยพ 24:3 "โมเสสจึงนำพระวจนะของพระเยโฮวาห์และคำตัดสินทั้งสิ้นมาชี้แจงให้ประชาชนทราบ ประชาชนทั้งปวงก็ตอบเป็นเสียงเดียวกันว่า "**พระวจนะทั้งหมดซึ่งพระเยโฮวาห์ตรัสไว้นั้น พวกเราจะกระทำตาม**""

1. The people had just experienced God
    1. The plagues in Egypt
    2. The Parting of the Red Sea
    3. Giving Food in the wilderness
    4. God descending upon the mountain with fire and lightings
    5. Then God gave Moses the commandments of God
2. The people's response
    1. "We will obey"
        1. Carried away by the moment and seeing the great glory of God and His terrifying power
        2. Their gut response is that they will do it!
    2. God then tells them what would happen if they don't obey
        1. famines
        2. wars
        3. exiled from the land
3. The people's performance
    1. They made a calf to worship while Moses was telling God the people's response.
    2. They refused to go into the promise land
    3. They killed many of God's prophets and refused to obey
    4. After God disciplines them with famines and wars until they were captives 70 years, they still refused to listen to God.
    5. When Christ came, they killed Him!
4. Their performance never matched their speech
    1. Their lack of love for God causes them to sin more and more
        - Matthew 24:12 "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."
        - มัทธิว 24:12 "ความรักของคนเป็นอันมากจะเยือกเย็นลง เพราะความชั่วช้าจะแผ่ขยายออกไป"
            1. Their love of self always overshadowed their love for God
            2. They wanted God and their ways at the same time
            3. It never can happen
5. Does your performance match up to your speech?
    1. You sing songs that say you love God and will follow God anywhere
    2. You promise God to follow Him if He helps you
    3. But, are you living up to that promise?
