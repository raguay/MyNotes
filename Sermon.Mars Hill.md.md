Acts 17:22-34

1. Paul traveled to Athens
  1. Athens people loved to hear stories
     1. Religion
     2. Philosophy
     3. Anything that was interesting
   1. Paul noticed their different alters
      1. They worshipped every god known to them
      2. Even an alter to an “unknown god”
         1. They were scared that they might of missed a god
         2. They wanted to cover all the possibilities to be safe
         3. They didn’t realize that that would keep them from being safe.
2. So he preached the Gospel about the God they didn't known
    1. God made the heavens and the earth v. 24
        1. He doesn't dwell in temples made with hands
    2. He can't be worshipped with thing made by men v. 25
        1. He gave everyone breath and life
    3. All of mankind is one blood v. 26
    4. Men should seek the Lord v. 27
    5. Since God created us in His image and his offspring v. 28
    6. Men shouldn't think God could be stone or gold, or anything by man's devices v. 29
    7. God winked at their ignorance v. 30
        1. He is now calling everyone to repent
    8. God has appointed Jesus to judge the world
        1. Those that reject the Gospel are lost 
        2. Those that accept Jesus is God and rose from the dead are saved
3. God is still waiting for others to trust in Him
    1. Not on what we do or have 
    2. But upon what Jesus did for us.
