Luke 15:11-32

1. A man has two sons
	1. The young asks for his inheritance and leaves home
	2. The oldest stays home and obeys his father
2. The younger son uses all his money
	1. Riotous living
		1. Living without any thought for tomorrow or for right and wrong
		2. Doing whatever the flesh wants to do
	2. Soon, the money is gone
		1. And all of his friends
	3. There is a famine
		1. He feeds swine for pay
		2. He would like to eat the swines food
3. He realizes his fault
	1. That all of his fathers servants each and dress better than he is right now
	2. He will return, confess his sin, and ask to be made a servant
4. The father sees him in the distance
	1. Runs to meet him
	2. Dresses him up in the finest clothes
	3. Kills the fated calf for a party for his returned son
5. The older son is mad
	1. His father never did the like for him
	2. He never asked either
6. All that the father has is the oldest son's
	1. But, the younger son has returned as from the dead
