Revelation 2:1-5 

1. Ephesus Church
    1. Full of working
        - sending missionaries
        - Bible translations
        - growing
    2. They were tiring out
        1. first sign of a problem
        2. God's work done with God's power isn't that tiring
    3. The problem
        1. they left their first love - Jesus
            1. The focus became the work, not whom they were working for
                1. Standing for the truth - Bible
                    - boldly pointing out error, but no love for person
                2. patience in trouble
                3. hating evil
                    - but, also the person - not like Christ
                4. Laboring for Christ
                    - but, methodically
                    - emphasis on results, technique, and skill instead of lovingly following God
            2. Jesus hates busy bodies
                1. He wants our
                    - attention to Him, not rules
                    - working because loving Him, not recognition
    4. Does this describe your service?
        - or, are you more like Laodacia - taking God's Grace for granted?
2. Steps to Recover
    1. Realizing this is our state
        1. Unfortunately, many are not willing to admit fault
        2. Just like Adam & Eve, blaming others instead of critically analyzing our own actions.
    2. Repent
        1. It is a state of sin because Jesus isn't our main focus!
    3. Do the first works
        1. labor out of love for Jesus
        2. follow Jesus, not leading Jesus
            - He will make us fishers of men (Matthew 4:19) if we are following Him!
3. If you refuse to recover
    1. Jesus removes our 'candle stick'
        1. Power to work for Him
        2. Conviction of sinners to repent
        3. Support when week and failing
