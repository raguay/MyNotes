Joel 1&2

1. Joel 1 - God's army of  palmerworm, locust, cankerworm , caterpiller (ตั๊กแตนวัยเดิน ตั๊กแตนวัยบิน ตั๊กแตนวัยกระโดด ตั๊กแตนวัยคลาน) to destroy the food
	1. A complete destruction of the food in Israel
		1. This is around the time queen Athaliah (อาธาลิยาห์) was reigning and Elisha was prophesying in the northern Israel
		2. This is the only prophet that didn't identify the reigning king
			1. Because there wasn't one
	2. God promised that this would happen as a judgement
		- Deuteronomy 29:25-27
			1. The curses that God gave to Egypt is what is referenced
			2. God destroyed Egypt with locusts, so God will destroy Israel for disobeying
	3. God fulfills this promise when Babylon destroys Israel
	4. The plague of locust is just a foreshadowing of the destruction of Israel 
2. Joel 2 - God's army of the north attacking Jerusalem as Christ returns
	1. The same imagery is now used to prophecy of the Anti-Christ's attack on Jerusalem
		- Revelation 19:11-21
3. The further future events are painted by the brush of the current events
	1. Just like looking at a mountain range
		1. The closer and smaller mountains hide much of the details of the larger, back-most mountains
		2. Therefore the vision uses a mixture of the two
	2. All old testament prophecy works in this manner.
		1. That is why you never fully understand them until they are being fulfilled
