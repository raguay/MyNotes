1. Teaching about Jesus' sheep - v. 1-18
   1. God's sheep are safe in His sheepfold (คอกแกะ)
   2. Robbers try to come in not by the door
      1. Only true believers can enter by the door
      2. Robbers, controlled by Satan, only kill and destroy the sheep
         1. Not literally, but spiritually so they can't witness
   3. God's sheep know his voice and follow after
   4. We have to enter God's fold by Jesus Only
      1. Because He is the only door
      2. Other ways of salvation don't get your through the door!
   5. Hirelings - pastors - my flee away
      1. Because they aren't the Master
      2. Only Jesus is the Good Shepard
         1. Because He lays down his life for the sheep
         2. No one can kill Him, He has to lay it down Himself
         3. Therefore, only put your faith and trust in the Lord
            1. Not the pastor or deacons
2. People disputing about Jesus - v. 19-24 
   1. Some believed what Jesus says due to the miracles
      1. But, they don't understand
   2. Others refuse to believe
      1. Saying He has a devil and therefore is crazy
      2. Some people call others crazy because they don't want to believe what Jesus says could be true.
3. Jesus explaining why people don't believe - v. 25-30
   1. They don't understand because they aren't His sheep
   2. Once someone gets saved, then they understand His Word
   3. He gives His sheep eternal life and no one can take that away
   4. He and the Father are one
      1. Jesus declares His deity once again
4. People try to kill Jesus - v. 31-33
   1. People like to destroy that which they don't understand
   2. They refuse to believe God could live among us
   3. What Jesus said didn't fit their world view of life
   4. Therefore, it should be eliminated by their thinking
5. Jesus using Bible to explain why it wasn't wrong to call himself the son of God - v. 34-38 - stopped
   1. In the Psalms, God's Word calls his people 'gods' and 'children of the most High'
      - Psalms 82:6-7: 'I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High. But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.'
      - Psalms 82:6 'เราได้กล่าวว่า “ท่านทั้งหลายเป็นพระ เป็นบุตรขององค์ผู้สูงสุด ท่านทุกคนนั่นแหละ ถึงกระนั้น ท่านก็จะตายอย่างมนุษย์และล้มลงเหมือนเจ้านายคนใดคนหนึ่ง”'
   2. Because they act like one
      1. They want to be the boss of their lives
      2. That is God's job
      3. But, they will all die because they are men
         1. God can't die!
   3. Therefore, it isn't wrong for the Son of God to call himself God
6. People again try to kill him - v. 39-42
