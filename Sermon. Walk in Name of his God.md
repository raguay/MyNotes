Micah 4:5 "For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and ever."

มีคาห์ 4:5 "ด้วยว่าบรรดาชนชาติทั้งหลายต่างก็ดำเนินในนามแห่งพระของตน แต่เราจะดำเนินในพระนามของพระเยโฮวาห์พระเจ้าของเราเป็นนิตย์สืบๆไป"

1. Walking
    1. It is our daily activity that defines our lives
        1. A designer has a daily activity of designing
        2. A writer has a daily activity of writing
        3. A doctor has a daily activity of helping others recover from illness
    2. Others know us by the our daily activity
        1. You hear people say, "he does this or that all the time"
2. God
    1. This term signifies that which controls
        1. daily activities
        2. decisions
        3. who we spend the most time with
    2. In simplest terms, it means 'he that is in control'
        1. If we control our lives, then we are our own god
        2. If pleasure controls our lives, then pleasure is our god
        3. If money controls our lives, then money is our god
3. Walking in the name of his god
    1. Our daily lives are characterized by the "god" we believe in
        1. Everyone does, as this verse says
        2. Our 'god' defines how we react, behave, and do
    2. People know how we will react by our "god"
        1. A person that walks after the "fun god" will always say 'yes' to fun activities.
        2. A person that walks in the name of "money god" will always say 'yes' to something that makes money.
    3. We have the tendency to "change gods" for the occasion
        1. When having fun, fun becomes our god
        2. When working, money becomes our god
        3. Many people are very fickle and change "gods" all the time
            1. Like the crowd that wanted to give Jesus the crown one day is crying out for his death in just 3 more days!
4. We need to decide to "Walk in the Name of Jesus!" only!
    1. It is something we have to decide to do
    2. It never just happens.
