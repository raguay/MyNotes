Luke 14:28-33

1. Two examples of things people plan
	1. King going to war
		1. The king will
			1. See how big the enemy is
			2. Compare to his own army and defenses
			3. Then, decide if he can win a war or not
				1. Looks for terms of surrender if he doesn't think he can win
				2. Usually best for the populace, but not the king
		2. He will never just recklessly assault the enemy
			1. No king will sacrifice his people for nothing!
	2. A man building a tower
		1. He will determine
			1. Size that he can afford
			2. Cost of everything to finish the construction
		2. Then build if he thinks he could easily do it
				1. No one wants to loose face over an unfinished work
2. The cost of following Christ
	1. The cost of salvation
		1. Willing to follow after the Lord
		2. Not doing our own wills
		3. We can't do it on our own, but God will empower us to do it!
	2. Many just want to get to heaven and don't think about the cost
		1. Not willing to live for God or even listen to Him
		2. They want to look good, but have no power to change due to denying God and His salvation
		3. They end up as false Christians and in hell
