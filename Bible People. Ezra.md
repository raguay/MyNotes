Ezra 1-10

Only chapters 7-10 talk about Ezra. 1-6 talk about the building of the Temple and the troubles with it.

1. God called Israel to return home by King Cyrus declaring them to go
    1. He told them to 
        1. rebuild the temple
            1. Started by King Cyrus during his reign
            2. In between these two king, lot's of opposition
            3. Started again and finished during King Darius' reign
        2. teach everyone in Israel about God and His ways
        3. All expenses were to come from the king's account
2. After the temple is built, but before the wall is rebuilt
    1. Ezra goes to Jerusalem
    2. He is a scribe
        1. He writes copies of the Old Testament
        2. He teaches what the Law of God says and means
    3. King Artaxerxes gives him authority to punish anyone that doesn't obey God's law
        1. Confiscation of goods
        2. Banishment
        3. Death
    4. He faithfully calls others to join him and perform the task
    5. He doesn't ask for a guard, but fasts and prays for safety
        1. They arrive in Jerusalem safely, no problems at all
        2. They give all the treasures from the King to the temple
3. Israel's transgression
    1. Many of the people had taken foreign wives that God forbid Israel to marry
        1. The wives and their children should never be accounted as a part of Israel
            - Deuteronomy 23:3 "An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:"
            - เฉลยธรรมบัญญัติ 23:3 "อย่าให้คนอัมโมนหรือคนโมอับเข้าในชุมนุมชนของพระเยโฮวาห์ บุคคลที่เป็นลูกหลานของคนทั้งสองตระกูลนี้ห้ามเข้าในชุมนุมชนของพระเยโฮวาห์เลยจนถึงสิบชั่วอายุคน"
                1. God only said the Ammonite (คนอัมโมน) and the Moabite (คนโมอับ)
                2. But, Ezra is applying it to all foreigners
        2. By the Law, the whole family should be removed from being a part of Israel
            1. when they marry, they are one flesh
                - Genesis 2:24 "Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh."
                - ปฐมกาล 2:24 "เหตุฉะนั้นผู้ชายจะจากบิดามารดาของเขา และจะไปผูกพันอยู่กับภรรยา และเขาทั้งสองจะเป็นเนื้ออันเดียวกัน""
            2. The law would then encompass both of them and their children
    2. Man's way of correcting
        1. Send away all the children and wives
            1. Then they will get new wives and still live in Israel
            2. A pure selfish act
        2. divorce is never right in God's eyes
        3. God never wrote a word of approval of the task
    3. Samaria are the descendants of the wives and children Israel divorced, along with the pagans the King of Babylon put there.
        1. Lots of hatred and contentions
        2. The fruit of the work is bad
