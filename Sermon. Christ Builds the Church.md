Matthew 16:16-18

1. Why build churches
   1. For lost people to know
      1. About Jesus
      2. Find a place of love and acceptance
   2. For Christians to know
      1. God's will in their lives
      2. God's word in their hearts
      3. Others are praying and encouraging them to continue in the faith
2. Christ builds His Church
   1. By
	   1. People hearing the Gospel
	   2. People putting their faith entirely upon Jesus
		   1. Not a mixture, but faith alone without works
	   3. People telling others so that they can hear
		   1. It starts the cycle again
		   2. Others can't hear without someone telling them
3. The church's enemy
   1. Hell
      1. It's trying to get everyone into it
      2. It's main agent - Devil
   2. But, they can't win
      1. God is on our side to win others to Him
      2. We are the victors!
