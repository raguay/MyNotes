Hebrews 7:19-28

1. Perfection
    1. Man can't achieve it
    2. We are sinners that can't do more by ourselves
    3. Nor by keeping the law can we be made perfect - v19
2. Priest of the tabernacle
    1. are but men
        1. Can't be made perfect by actions
        2. born in the state of a sinner
    2. Made priest by a law
        1. Just the line of Aaron
        2. No one else allowed except for God interceding
    3. They had to offer sacrifices often
        1. Because it did not remove the guilt of sin
        2. Nor the ultimate penalty
    4. Therefore, they still died and others had to take their place
        1. They could not continue in their office of priest
        2. Death stopped their service for God
3. But Jesus
    1. Is the son of God
    2. Made a priest by an oath of God
    3. Offered a sacrifice of himself but once
    4. He ever lives to make intercession
        1. He can therefore save anyone forever!!!
