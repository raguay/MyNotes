# Walk of Faith

John 9:1-7 :- Blind man healed by mud and water

4 times the Bible says we are to walk by faith:

Habakkuk 2:4 "Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith."

Romans 1:17 "For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith."

Galatians 3:11 "But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."

Hebrews 10:38 "Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him."

			2. God never does such a thing, but people often think that way about God
	2. People are always looking for someone to blame
		1. Somehow makes them feel better
	3. But, it is simply due to the state of sin in the world
		1. The wages of sin is death
		2. Therefore, the world is under the control of death
		3. God did not make it that way, man's general rebellion against God created the problem.
		4. But, God works together for good in our lives
			Romans 8:28: 'And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.'

4. Are we walking by faith?
	1. We will hear his voice
		1. When He speaks, we have to decide to follow
		2. Not following causes us to not walk by faith
	2. We will be leading others to Him
		Matthew 4:19 "And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."
