Matthew 5:41 "And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain."

มัทธิว 5:41 "ถ้าผู้ใดจะเกณฑ์ท่านให้เดินทางไปหนึ่งกิโลเมตร ก็ให้เลยไปกับเขาถึงสองกิโลเมตร"

1. Compel to go a mile
    1. This comes from a law in that Time period
        1. Nothing else in the Bible will explain this verse
        2. You will only understand it by understanding the time period
            1. Not just laws and the general accepted things of a time
            2. You have to also understand their customs
            3. This comes from a blend of custom and law
        3. Therefore, If you want to study the Bible, you need to study the time period that the book your studying was written.
    2. In that time period, the Romans had rule over all of Israel
        1. They controlled taxes, military, building, about everything
        2. They had complete rule over Israel people's lives
    3. They had an interesting law/custom
        1. A roman solder can command you to carry their backpack
            1. They can only make you do it for one roman mile (1,473 meters)
            2. Only if you aren't a Roman citizen
            3. It could not be more than what the solder was already carrying
        2. Any disobedience to a command from a Roman solder was death.
2. Jesus says, go two miles
    1. The first is obedience
        1. By obeying, we show that we respect our authority
        2. People who disobey do not respect their authorities!
    2. The second is an act of love
        1. By going beyond the law, we show God's love to others
        2. This is beyond human nature to do.
3. We show love by doing more than commanded
    1. God commands to give a tithe, 1/10 of your income
        1. If you obey, you show your respect to God
        2. If you give more, you show God your love for Him
    2. Showing others love opens doors to witness to them!
