2. But, it's 3 different people
    1. James, the son of Zebadee and brother of John
        1. An Apostle of Jesus
        2. This is the James that was killed in Acts 12:2 by Herod

            1. Peter was next, but the Lord helped him escape.
            2. After Peter's escape, Herod quit trying to kill Apostles
    2. James the son of Alphaeus
        1. An Apostle of Jesus
        2. Since Matthew is also the son of Alphaeus, some believe they were brothers
        3. James and John are brothers and are identified as such in the Bible, so why not James and Matthew?
            1. Maybe, because Matthew was the black sheep of the family since me became a tax collector
        4. Also known as "James the lesser" (ยากอบน้อย) - Mark 15:40
            1. which is a reference to his age 
            2. It had nothing to do with importance
    3. James, the brother of Jesus
        1. This is the James that became the pastor of the church in Jerusalem
            1. He became pastor as the Apostles started to travel more
                1. The church was first governed by all the Apostles - Acts 5:2
                2. They were slowly learning how to have a church
                3. Paul wrote the church epistles much later
        2. This James wasn't an apostle because none of Jesus' family believed in him until after the resurrection
            - John 7:5 "For neither did his brethren believe in him."
            - ยอห์น 7:5 "แม้พวกน้องๆของพระองค์ก็มิได้เชื่อในพระองค์"
                1. Verses referring to him as Jesus' brother
                    - Matthew 13:55 "Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?"
                    - มัทธิว 13:55 "คนนี้เป็นลูกช่างไม้มิใช่หรือ มารดาของเขาชื่อมารีย์มิใช่หรือ และน้องชายของเขาชื่อยากอบ โยเสส ซีโมน และยูดาสมิใช่หรือ"
                        1. This Judas isn't the Apostle Judas that wrote the book of Jude.
                    - Galatians 1:19 "But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother."
                    - กาลาเทีย 1:19 "แต่ว่าข้าพเจ้าไม่ได้พบอัครสาวกคนอื่นเลย นอกจากยากอบน้องชายขององค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้า"
        3. This James also wrote the book of James
