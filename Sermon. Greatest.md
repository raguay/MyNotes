Mark 9:33-37

1. The Disciples disputed
    1. Who was the greatest among themselves
    2. More of a pride parade than a discussion
    3. Jesus knew what they were discussing
        1. The disciples never told him
        2. But, Jesus goes and explains who will be great
2. To be first
    1. You must be last
        1. A realization that we don't deserve the honor of being first
        2. Whatever we do for Jesus, is the least we should do
            - Luke 17:7-10
    2. Work as a servant, not a master
        1. We serve others around us
        2. Not masters or bosses, but a servant that is always looking to help others.
        3. Because, we are God's servants
            1. Jesus did boss people around
            2. He served them and treated others with honor.
    3. As a child, not promoting self
        1. At the most, a child promotes the parents
        2. Little children never promotes themselves
3. The same as recieving Christ
    1. Not by merit
        1. It has nothing to do with what we do
        2. Our best works are filthy in God's eyes
    2. But, as a child recieves from his parents
        1. Kids have no motive other than following their parents
        2. Likewise, we receive Jesus by willing to follow Him
        3. Which allows us to receive God the father also
