Jeremiah 10:2 "Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them."

เยเรมีย์ 10:2 "พระเยโฮวาห์ตรัสดังนี้ว่า "อย่าเรียนรู้วิถีทางแห่งบรรดาประชาชาติ หรืออย่าคร้ามกลัวเพราะหมายสำคัญของท้องฟ้า ตามที่บรรดาประชาชาติคร้ามกลัวนั้น"

1. "ways (วิถีทาง)"
    1. The things people do every day or on special occasions
        1. Saying "good luck" when someone goes to do something
        2. Using bowls, spoons, cups, etc. for specific things, but would never use the same thing for everyday use
        3. Wearing a cross with Jesus on it for good luck
    2. The context here is things pertaining to worship other gods/religions
        1. Most religions carry over to their daily lives, not just something done at a center of worship
            - 1 Samuel 5:5 "Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day."
            - 1ซามูเอล 5:5 "เพราะเหตุนี้เองปุโรหิตของพระดาโกนและผู้ที่เข้าไปในนิเวศของพระดาโกน จึงไม่เหยียบธรณีประตูนิเวศพระดาโกนที่เมืองอัชโดดจนถึงทุกวันนี้"
                1. They added a daily practice of not stepping on the threshold (ธรณีประตู)
                2. Later, stepping on a crack anywhere was considered bad luck through out Europe and then America.
        2. We need to identify those things in our lives and not do them!
2. Not to learn
    1. about them or participate with them
        1. Many missionaries have gone to other countries and heavily studied their religions
            1. They figure that if they understand them, they can figure the best way to tell them about Christ.
            2. In the end, many leave Christian service and follow those other ways or just become non-religious
            3. Some people try to know everything about all religions to try to combine them or find their common grounds
                1. Usually end up crazy
    2. God spoke this verse to Israel that should not know the ways of the heathen
        1. God called them for many generations a separate people that should only follow Him
    3. Therefore, God expected them to not already know their ways
        1. But in reality, they learned a lot of bad practices from Egypt and the people they didn't drive out
        2. They learned their ways because the lived around them everyday without thinking that they are wrong
3. What about us, who were born in their ways?
    1. We need to identify them and remove them from our lives
    2. We need to critically examine why we do things and for what purpose
        1. If they have any connection to false worship - quit doing it!
        2. Would you use those items, procedures for common everyday activities?
    3. Some are so ingrained into us that we can't tell
        1. We need to be asking God for His judgement on it
        2. Only God can truly help us in this area, but we have to be willing to change anything to please Him
