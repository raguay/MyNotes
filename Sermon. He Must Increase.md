John 3:30-36

1. John here declares his role in life
	1. John is just a servant sent from God
		1. God called him to proclaim his coming
		2. Everything John did was to declare who Jesus is
	2. His influence, power, authority must decrease
		1. People were trying to place him in too high of esteem
		2. They wanted a reason that he did these things
		3. They assumed John was as Moses
			1. He is, Moses pointed Israel to God
			2. But, they gave Moses more authority than God
			3. Many of them basically worshiped Moses
			4. He is telling them that he isn't what is important, Jesus is!
2. Everyone should be as John
	1. Make ourselves less important to our life
		1. Don't focus on your wants, but God's wants
		2. Anger, bitterness, frustration comes from making self more important
	2. We need Jesus to increase in our life
		1. Make Jesus more important to our life

				- 2 Peter 3:9 'องค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าไม่ได้ทรงเฉื่อยช้าในเรื่องพระสัญญาของพระองค์ ตามที่บางคนคิดนั้น แต่พระองค์ได้ทรงอดกลั้นพระทัยไว้ เพราะเห็นแก่เราทั้งหลายมาช้านาน ไม่ทรงประสงค์ที่จะให้ผู้หนึ่งผู้ใดพินาศเลย แต่ทรงปรารถนาที่จะให้คนทั้งปวงกลับใจเสียใหม่'
