Matthew 16:19 "And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."

มัทธิว 16:19 "เราจะมอบลูกกุญแจของอาณาจักรแห่งสวรรค์ให้ไว้แก่ท่าน ท่านจะผูกมัดสิ่งใดในโลก สิ่งนั้นก็จะถูกมัดในสวรรค์ และท่านจะปล่อยสิ่งใดในโลก สิ่งนั้นจะถูกปล่อยในสวรรค์"
