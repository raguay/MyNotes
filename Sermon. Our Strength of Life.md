Psalms 27:1 
Psalms 27:14 

1. The Lord God is
    1. Our light
        1. He shows us the path of life we need to take
        2. He shows our past in light of His Word
            1. Helps us correct our wrong thoughts and mistakes
            2. Encouraging us to walk after Him more
    2. Our Salvation
        1. He saves us because of His love for us
        2. We can't earn it, He gives it to those that trust and follow after Him
    3. Strength of Life
        1. Our life is from Him
        2. Our life is by Him
        3. He gives us strength for the life He wants us to live
2. Which produces bravery
    1. If God is with us, who could be against us and win?
        - Romans 8:31 "What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?"
        - โรม 8:31 "ถ้าเช่นนั้นเราจะว่าอย่างไร ถ้าพระเจ้าทรงอยู่ฝ่ายเรา ใครจะขัดขวางเรา"
            1. Since nothing is stronger than God
                1. We are completely safe
                2. If we die, we just go to heaven because God is with us!
    2. He will strengthen our hearts
        1. To be even braver
        2. Because we wait upon Him, not our own understanding
3. But, we need to wait upon the Lord
    1. His timing, not ours
    2. His way, not our ideas
    3. It's all His work and He will bring it to pass.
4. And then find joy in serving the Lord
	- Nehemiah 8:10 "...for the joy of the LORD is your strength."
	- เนหะมีย์ 8:10 "...โฮวาห์เป็นกำลังของท่าน""
		1. Our strength comes from the Lord
		2. When we joyfully serve Him
			1. He gives more and more strength
