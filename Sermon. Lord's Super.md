1 Corinthians 11:23-30

1. It is a time to remember
    1. Why Jesus had to die.
        1. Our sins
        2. It was the only way to we can go to heaven
    2. The sacrifice for the sin's of all mankind
        1. Our sins are many
        2. The price is large
            1. Only eternal life could make that sacrifice
            2. God became just like us, but never sinned
                - Hebrews 4:15 'For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.'
                - Hebrews 4:15 "เพราะว่าเรามิได้มีมหาปุโรหิตที่ไม่สามารถจะเห็นใจในความอ่อนแอของเรา แต่ได้ทรงถูกทดลองเหมือนอย่างเราทุกประการ ถึงกระนั้นพระองค์ก็ยังปราศจากบาป"
            3. Then suffered more than any man could suffer 
                1. Separated from God
                2. Dying on the cruel cross
2. We should reflect on
    1. Are we worthy?
        - Matthew 16:24: 'Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.'
        - มัทธิว 16:24 'ขณะนั้นพระเยซูจึงตรัสกับเหล่าสาวกของพระองค์ว่า “ถ้าผู้ใดใคร่ตามเรามา ให้ผู้นั้นเอาชนะตัวเอง และรับกางเขนของตนแบกและตามเรามา'
            1. Are we trying to follow His example and picking up our cross daily?
                1. We don't die, our cross is the work God has for each of us.
                2. Jesus' job was to die in our place.
                3. Everyday Jesus followed the Father all the way to the cross
                    1. Jesus knew it.
                    2. Jesus accepted whatever the Father wanted for Him
                    3. Everyday Jesus just did the Father's will
            2. Is following Him our goal in life as it was Jesus' goal?
            3. Are we sorrowful for our sin, or sorry for the consequences?
    2. Those that take it unworthily
        1. They are guilty of the Blood
        2. They are guilty of denying Him
        3. They are consuming illnesses upon themselves
3. Therefore, let us examine ourselves
    1. If you are unworthy
        1. confess your sins
        2. Tell Jesus you're willing to pick up your cross daily and then do it!
            1. Just saying you will and not trying is lying
            2. God knows the difference!
        3. You will be healed
    2. If you are worthy
        1. Rejoice that God loves you that much!!!
