1 Corinthians 11:23-30

1. It is a time to remember
   1. Why Jesus had to die.
      1. Our sins
      2. It was the only way to allow mankind into heaven
2. We should reflect on
   1. Are we worthy
      1. Are we trying to follow His example?
      2. Is following Him our goal in life?
      3. Are we sorryful for our sin, or sorry for the consequences?
   2. Those that take it unworthyly
      1. They are guilty of the Blood
      2. They are guilty of denying Him
      3. They are consuming illnesses upon themselves
3. Therefore, let us examine ourselves
   1. If you are unworthy
      1. confess your sins
      2. You will be healed
   2. If you are worthy
      1. Rejoice that God loves you that much!!!
