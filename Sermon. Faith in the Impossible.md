Acts 27:21-25

1. Paul major problem
    1. Paul was in a boat far from land
    2. Storm tossed for many days
    3. No end in sight
    4. No one had eaten in 14 days trying to keep the ship afloat
2. But, God reassures Paul
    1. No one would die
    2. But, the ship would be lost
        1. but, they were on the ship!
        2. God said they will be "tossed upon an island" - literally, thrown
3. Paul chose to believe God
    1. Even though he was a prisoner with a sentence of death on his head
    2. His faith was contagious - everyone enjoyed a meal
    3. And, everything went just as God said.
4. If we say we believe God will save us from hell
    1. Why do we often doubt in smaller problems
        1. Shipwreck is smaller than eternity in hell
