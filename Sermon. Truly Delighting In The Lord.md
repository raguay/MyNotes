Psalms 37:4 "Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart."

สดุดี 37:4 "จงปีติยินดีในพระเยโฮวาห์และพระองค์จะประทานตามใจปรารถนาของท่าน"

1. Delight (ปีติยินดี)
	1. It happens when we love what we are doing
		1. Many people delight themselves in food, entertainment, sports
		2. They love doing those things and they make time for them
			1. Even if they have to give up other things they like
2. In the Lord
	1. Loving to do things for God
		1. Christian Homework becomes a joy and not a drudgery
		2. We look forward to doing those things
	2. Because we love God
		1. For giving us salvation for free
		2. Helping us escape hell and problems in this life
		3. Strengthening us for what we have to endure here
		4. Empowering us to do more for Him
3. Then He loves to give us the desires of our heart
	1. Just like a father loves to give good things to his children
		1. As long as they don't injure in any way
4. When we delight ourselves in God
	1. What He wants we want
	2. Therefore, He freely gives use what we need to do His will
