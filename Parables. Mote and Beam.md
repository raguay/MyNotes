Matthew 7:1-6
Luke 6:37-43

1. Mote and Beam
    1. They are the same fault or problem
        1. They are basically the same size object in two people's eyes
        2. The object represents a problem area in their lives
    2. In someone else's eye
        1. It will appear small
        2. Because of distance from the observer
    3. In our own eye
        1. It is large due to being next to the eye
2. We judge others by what we see wrong in ourselves
    1. If we have the same issue
        1. We are harder on others about it
        2. We would like to get rid of it ourself, but find it hard
    2. If others have a fault that we don't have, we tend to ignore it
        1. This is what Jesus was getting at
            1. We have the tendency to ignore problems that we don't have and be too hard on problem we do have
            2. If we judge them, it's because we are worthy of judgement
3. We need to examine ourselves first
    - Galatians 6:1 "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
    - กาลาเทีย 6:1 "พี่น้องทั้งหลาย ถ้าผู้ใดถูกครอบงำอยู่ในความผิดบาป ท่านซึ่งอยู่ฝ่ายพระวิญญาณ จงช่วยผู้นั้นด้วยใจอ่อนสุภาพให้เขากลับตั้งตัวใหม่ โดยคิดถึงตัวเอง เกรงว่าท่านจะถูกชักจูงให้หลงไปด้วย"
        1. If we love others, we will try to help them with their problems
        2. But, since we notice it, we need to make sure we aren't too harsh about it because it's most likely our problem as well.
