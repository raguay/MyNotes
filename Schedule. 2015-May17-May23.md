James 1:5-8 :- Ask Believing, Double Minded Man

# Thursday English Service:

Romans 6:9-12 "Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."

1. Christ's death and shed blood destroyed sin's power over our lives

	2. God wants us to live for Him

			Isaiah 64:6 "But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away."
		2. Doing what we want will never please God
2. Our lives are to be:
	1. Unto God
		1. For God
		2. Powered by God

	2. Because

		2. He should rightfully control our lives
