1 Thessalonians 5:17 "Pray without ceasing."
1เธสะโลนิกา 5:17 "จงอธิษฐานอย่างสม่ำเสมอ"

1. God commands prayer Without Ceasing!!!
    1. We often read it and think "sure"
        1. It sounds like an impossible task
        2. How can we pray all the time and still get our work done?
    2. But, prayer is more than just the time we spend alone with God
        1. It is an attitude and practice of taking everything to God first
            1. He is the one we tell everything too.
        2. It becomes a reflex to just talk to God about everything in your life
    3. The test of proper attitude with prayer
        1. Who do you go to first with a problem?
            1. If it's not God, we don't plan to pray without ceasing
            2. If it is God, then we have conditioned our heart to pray without ceasing!
2. What it isn't
    1. Praying through a list
        1. That is intercession prayer for needs
        2. It isn't a time of sharing with God
            1. Because we are just telling God what we want
            2. There is a time for that, but that isn't the focus of this verse
        3. True prayer is a conversation with Jesus
            1. Just like you talk with your best friend
            2. Always looking to Jesus for direction and receiving direction
    2. A "if your there" type of talk
        1. It has to be by faith
        2. You truly believe God cares for you and will answer or talk with you
        3. If you aren't sure, it's not faith
    3. If I'm worthy to talk with you
        1. All are made worthy by Jesus' death, burial, and ressurection.
        2. Nothing we do makes us worthy to talk with God
