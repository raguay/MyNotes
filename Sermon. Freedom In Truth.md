John 8:31-32: 'Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed; And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'

1. We are called to continue in His Word
    1. Study His Word daily
    2. Follow His Word daily
3. Know the truth
    1. Our own will and way isn't His will and way
        - Isaiah 55:9: 'For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.'
    2. The more we study God's Word, the more we see our need for Him to change us 
        - 2 Corinthians 3:18: 'But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.'
4. Truth shall make us free
    1. To do the work He calls us to do 
        1. We can't do it on our own because of our sinfullness
        2. God works through us to beform the work He wants done
    2. We all have a special job that God wants us to do.
        1. The parable of the talents
            1. Each servant had a job to do while doing his normal activities (make use of the talent - money)
            2. The one that refused to use it was cast into hell - because he wasn't true
    3. As we follow God's Word, we are enabled to do the work
        1. Free from distractions of the world
        2. Free from our own selfishness
        3. Free from satan's schemes to trip us up
