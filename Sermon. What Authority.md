Matthew 21:23-27

1. The religious group questions Jesus' Authority
    1. Who gave you this authority?
    2. The question: Baptism of John - men or heaven
        1. They could not tell
            1. Because they were afraid of public opinion
            2. They didn't want to admit it was from God because they didn't want to follow it
        2. Therefore, Jesus would not tell them either
            1. That was the deal!
            2. God always follows the rules!
2. But the issue still keeps going on
    1. People question authorities
        1. Is the old testament for now a days?
        2. Can Christians divorce?
        3. Who gave the government the right to force quarantine?
    2. When someone wants to know who gave the right
        1. It's because they don't want to follow or listen to them
            1. They want their way and only their way.
        2. If you have no issue with obeying, you don't care who gave them the authority.
    3. Especially when they are ordained of God
        - Romans 13:1 "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God."
        - โรม 13:1 "คริสเตียนจงยอมอยู่ใต้การปกครองของผู้มีอำนาจทุกคนจงยอมอยู่ใต้บังคับของผู้ที่มีอำนาจ เพราะว่าไม่มีอำนาจใดเลยที่มิได้มาจากพระเจ้า และผู้ที่ทรงอำนาจนั้นพระเจ้าทรงแต่งตั้งขึ้น"
3. So, Are you questioning authority?
