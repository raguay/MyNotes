2 Timothy 1:14 "That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us."

1. Every Christian has been intrusted with a very prescious item
   1. It protects us    
   2. It teaches us
   3. It helps us to know God's will and direction in life
   4. It has more knowledge than any other single book
   5. It is God's Word!
2. Why protect it?
   1. God said so!
   2. The Devil wants to destroy it
3. How to keep it?
   1. know what God's Word says and is about
      1. We will know when someone tries to teach against it.
   2. Living by it
      1. Our lives will proclaim what it says
      2. Others can see it through our lives and actions as we allow it to change us.
   3. But, not by our own efforts
      1. Trying to know God's Word by our own ideas leads to heresy
      2. Living after God's Word by our own efforts leads to legalism
      3. It has to be by The Holy Spirit working it into our lives
         1. Asking God to help us
         2. Willing for God to change us
4. If we don't?
   1. Future generations will not know God's Word!
   2. We'll have loss of rewards in heaven.
   3. Many will go to Hell by our own hands.
