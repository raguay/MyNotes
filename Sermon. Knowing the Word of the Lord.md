Jeremiah 32:6-8

1. We often want to know the "Word of the Lord"
   1. This is God's direction in our lives
      1. Only Christians receive a "Word of the Lord"
         1. It is how God directs our lives day by day
         2. God always speaks to us directly, not through others
      2. Christians have to ask for it as well
   2. Those that aren't interested in God' direction
      1. Typically lost people, but often Christians are this way as well
      2. Can't get God's Word on their problems
      3. They have to figure things out for themselves
2. Jeremiah receives a "Word of the Lord"
   1. First, he hears God speaking to him
      1. It could have been an audible voice or just in his heart
      2. The Bible doesn't say how he heard God speak
      3. But, Jeremiah knew to try the spirits
         - 1 John 4:1: 'Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.'
         - 1 ยอห์น 4:1 ท่านที่รักทั้งหลาย อย่าเชื่อวิญญาณเสียทุกๆวิญญาณ แต่จงพิสูจน์วิญญาณเหล่านั้นว่ามาจากพระเจ้าหรือไม่ เพราะว่ามีผู้พยากรณ์เท็จเป็นอันมากออกเที่ยวไปในโลก"
           1. Only that which comes from God speaks the whole truth.
              1. No partial truths
           2. There are demons and devils that are trying to stop us from following God.
              1. By saying something will happen, but it doesn't
              2. Or, by being so vague that it would match most situations
              3. Or, by having some happen and some not happen
                 1. The things that do happen is something that usually anyone could guess it
   2. Second, the thing God spoke to Jeremiah happened exactly
      1. It wasn't off by any, but accurately happened so that it was clearly God that had spoken.
   3. Then Jeremiah declares that it was the "Word of the Lord"
      1. Since it happened exactly to the detail, he knew it was from God.
      2. It wasn't a metaphor (อุปมาอุปไมย) or a picture (รูปภาพ) of it, but the exact action happened.
3. Many Christians get miss led by what they think is "Word of the Lord"
   1. That is way God tells us to be careful.
   2. We need to study and know God's Word to verify what is from God
      1. God never speaks to us contrary to the Word of God
