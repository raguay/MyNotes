Colossians 1:9-12

1. Paul didn't start the Colossians Church
    1. It was started by other churches that Paul worked in (Ephesus Church)
    2. They were mostly Gentile believers, almost no Jews there
2. Paul is praying
    1. Without ceasing
        1. He is obeying
            - 1 Thessalonians 5:17 'Pray without ceasing.'
            - 1เธสะโลนิกา 5:17 "จงอธิษฐานอย่างสม่ำเสมอ"
    2. Them to be filled - to overflowing
        1. Knowledge of His will
        2. Wisdom
        3. Spiritual understanding
3. Goal of Praying
    1. Walking worthy of God
        1. Walking with Jesus
            1. not in self-will
            2. It's a way of life allowing Jesus to live through us
        2. Living as Jesus would in this world
            1. Jesus was our example in this type of life
    2. Fruitful in the work of God
        1. Not just new converts
            1. New converts should be a by product of walking with God
            2. But, as Noah shows us, it's not the main result!
        2. Encouraging and helping others to walk with Jesus
        3. Increasing in the Fruit of the Spirit
            - Galatians 5:22-23 "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
            - กาลาเทีย 5:22-23 "ผลของพระวิญญาณฝ่ายผลของพระวิญญาณนั้นคือ ความรัก ความปลาบปลื้มใจ สันติสุข ความอดกลั้นใจ ความปรานี ความดี ความเชื่อ ความสุภาพอ่อนน้อม การรู้จักบังคับตน เรื่องอย่างนี้ไม่มีพระราชบัญญัติห้ามไว้เลย"
    3. Increasing in Knowledge of God
        1. This is experience in working with God
        2. Not book knowledge
    4. Strengthened in God's power
        1. God's strength is visible in our lives as we walk with Jesus
        2. It is something that is beyond the ordinary
    5. Patience and Long-suffering with Joyfulness
        1. This comes with God's power and grace in our lives
        2. Totally foreign to the lost world, but much appriciated by them
4. The end result
    1. Making us and everyone around us thankful to God
    2. He has changed our lives and empowered us to live for Him
    3. He has given us inheritance
