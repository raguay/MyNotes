Luke 16:1-9

1. A steward
	1. One in charge of the house, properties, and money
		1. He pays the servants
		2. He checks for needed repairs and gets them done
		3. He checks for adequate protection for everything
		4. Joseph was Pottipher's steward - a great example
	2. He doesn't own anything in the master's house
		1. He just manages it and the money
	3. Therefore, they should be faithful
		1. Someone the master that trust to
			1. look after his things
			2. do what he says
2. The unjust steward
	4. Is accused of wasting his master's goods
		2. Just buying what is easy without looking for better deals
		3. Keeping some for self - but not lots
			1. pocketing change instead of giving it back
	5. The master believed the accusers and did not listen to any explanation
		4. It was assumed if anyone would give an accusation, then
			2. It is true
			3. Or, the steward did wrong in some other way
3. The steward is lazy and prideful
	1. He couldn't dig (manual labor)
	2. He couldn't ask for help
4. So, he planed to make everyone love him
	1. By having each person change their bill
		1. The owner had debtors that owed money
			1. for services given
			2. for thing purchased
	2. This was evidently something that wasn't considered stealing or wrong
		2. It was in the power of the steward to name any price for service or loans that was given to others.
		3. Therefore, changing what they owed was fine
		4. He made sure it was in the persons handwriting so that they had agreed to it.
		5. This also mean the owner will get something back if not the whole amount.
			1. Many of the debtors had no way to pay the full amount.
			2. By lowering it, they feel they can pay it off and the owner does get some of his money back.
	3. When he left the stewardship
		1. The people offered to help him out.
5. The owner commended him
	1. He found a legal way to take care of himself by using those around in the world
	2. Christians should make good friendships with the lost
		1. Not follow them
		2. But, be friendly with them and helpful
			1. Then when we have a problem, they will help us as well.
6. This doesn't teach
	1. Loosing one's salvation
	2. Loosing rewards in heaven
		1. When we follow God and do His will we get rewards in heaven
		2. Not following or doing His will doesn't give us rewards in heaven
			1. And it doesn't take away from what we have already in heaven
	3. It's okay to cheat others
		1. That is always a sin
			- Proverbs 11:1 "A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight."
			- สุภาษิต 11:1 "ตราชูเทียมเท็จนั้นเป็นที่น่าสะอิดสะเอียนต่อพระเยโฮวาห์ แต่ลูกตุ้มเที่ยงตรงเป็นความปีติยินดีของพระองค์"
7. How does this apply to us - v. 10-11 
	1. We are stewards of God’s possessions.
		1. God owns everything we have.
			1. We have strength to have jobs by God's will.
		2. We are just stewards of what God allows us to have.
			1. Things of this world are not the true riches.
			2. Stuff of this world are just tools God gives us to serve Him.
	2. Are we good stewards of what God has given us?
		1. Are we using our money and time wisely for God's glory?
		2. Or are we using it for our own selfish desires?
	3. Our true riches are in heaven and the new heavens and new earth.
		1. If we aren't faithful stewards of what we have here, who will intrust us with more in heaven?
