Genesis 37:2-11, 19-28

1. Jacob and God favored Joseph
    1. Jacob made him special cloths and less work
    2. God gave him visions of the future
        1. God meant for him to keep to himself
        2. They are to encourage him in the difficult times to come
2. Jacob's brothers envied him
    - Acts 7:9 "And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,"
    - กิจการ 7:9 "ฝ่ายบรรพบุรุษเหล่านั้นคิดอิจฉาโยเซฟจึงขายเขาไปยังประเทศอียิปต์    แต่พระเจ้าทรงสถิตกับโยเซฟ"
        1. They couldn't speak to him lovingly at all
        2. They despised and hated him
        3. They looked for ways to kill him
            1. With him out of the way, their father would show them more love.
            2. But, it didn't help, Jacob ignored them and morned over Joseph
3. Even though God used their envy for good
    1. It was still sin on their part
    2. They had guilt over it all their lives
        1. They kept asking Joseph for forgiveness and even lied that their father requested it of Joseph
        2. Joseph kept reaffirming his love to them
            1. Their envy kept them from seeing or receiving any love from Joseph
4. The Bible warns about envy
    1. The dangers of envy
        - Job 5:2: 'For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.'  
        - Proverbs 14:30: 'A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.'  
        - Proverbs 23:17: 'Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.'  
    2. Envy is the fruit of a lost life (10 times)
        - Romans 1:29, Romans 13:13, 1 Corinthians 3:3, 2 Corinthians 12:20, Galatians 5:21, Galatians 5:26, 1 Timothy 6:4, Titus 3:3, James 3:14, James 3:16
            1. It comes from a heart that is dissatified with God's plan for their life.
            2. They want the life that others have instead.
            3. They deny God's right to control their lives.
