Luke 24:13-35

1. Two disciples travel home after the resurrection, but before Jesus appears to all the disciples
    1. Cleopas and another person
        1. Some believe it to be his wife or a relative since they live in the same house
        2. The Bible doesn't say except that they lived in the same house.
    2. About 7.5 miles (12 km), a 2-4 hour walk
        1. most likely 4 hours since it is mountainous area
        2. In a dead run, 2 hours would be possible in a mountainous area
    3. Their eyes were "holden" (ฟางไป)
        1. They weren't made blind, they just couldn't tell who it was talking to them.
        2. Same thing that God did to the soldiers trying to capture Elisha (2 Kings 6:8-23)
            1. It was described as a blindness, but really they could travel and follow Elisha just fine.
            2. Their eyes were made to believe what they saw was something else than what was really there.
        3. Their eyes were holden due to unbelief that Jesus had risen from the dead.
            1. No one had ever raised themselves up from the dead
            2. Several prophets and Jesus had raised up others, but no one had ever raised themselves up from the dead.
    4. Jesus explains all the Bible references about himself to them
        1. He had to die and rise again the third day
    5. They constrained Jesus to enter their house with them
    6. They knew Jesus when He broke the bread and gave to them
    7. They quickly went back to Jerusalem to tell the other disciples.
2. How many times are our eyes "holden"?
    1. Like them, our eyes are "holden" when we do not believe God is working in our lives
    2. We can't see God's work due to disbelief
    3. God wants to manifest himself to us, but we are "blinded" to the work He is doing around us.
        1. Because we are
            1. just lazy
            2. disobedient
            3. busy working, but not on what God wants.
            4. Indifference (ไม่แยแสกับ) to God, we become our own bosses
    4. Simply confess the sin and make a heart felt commitment to work with God
        1. We will then start to see God working around us.
