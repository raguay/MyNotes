Matthew 18:15-17

1. The context is finding lost sheep
    1. This is right after the parable of the 99 sheep and one missing
    2. Really, everyone says the lost sheep is a lost person
        1. It can be
        2. But, it can also be one that is saved, but refuses to follow the Bible.
2. Steps to help the person come back to God
    1. Tell him yourself
        1. Not your opinions
            1. Opinions just create arguments
            2. There isn't a basis of truth for opinions
        2. But, show the truth from God's word.
            - John 8:32 "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free."
            - ยอห์น 8:32 "และท่านทั้งหลายจะรู้จักความจริง และความจริงนั้นจะทำให้ท่านทั้งหลายเป็นไทย"
        3. Your trying to help someone who misunderstands God's Word, therefore, correct with God's Word
    2. Take someone with you if the person doesn't listen to you
        1. All truth is vouched by two to three witnesses
        2. It keeps the person from saying that the another person didn't do
        3. Helps keep things from being an augument
    3. If they still do not listen, then tell the church
        1. Present the Biblical evidence of error to everyone
        2. Give the person another chance to repent
        3. If they still don't listen, in the church, they no longer can 
            1. teach
            2. hold an office - pastor, deacon, Sunday shool teacher, janitor, etc.
            3. vote on activities
        4. No one can really stop someone from coming to church
            1. Unless they are disrupting the meeting
                - 1 Corinthians 14:40 "Let all things be done decently and in order."
                - 1โครินธ์ 14:40 "แต่สิ่งสารพัดซึ่งจะกระทำนั้น จงกระทำตามสมควร และให้เป็นระเบียบเรียบร้อย"
            2. Someone that disrupts meeting shows plainly they are against the truth.
                - Psalms 119:165 "Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall offend them."
                - สดุดี 119:165 "บุคคลเหล่านั้นที่รักพระราชบัญญัติของพระองค์มีสันติภาพใหญ่ยิ่ง ไม่มีสิ่งใดกระทำให้เขาสะดุดได้"
                    1. If we are following God, then things will not offend us.
            3. If they aren't disruptive, then let them come and show God's love
                1. But, don't change Biblical truth to make them happy
                2. Stick with the truth!
3. Therefore, it is the person who sees another teaching/doing things against God's Word
    1. Not about opinions or preferences
    2. The person that claims the other is doing wrong is to do the above
        1. People doing wrong don't usually see it
        2. We all have blind spots in our lives and we need others to help us
    3. These steps show your love for the person
        1. If you don't love them, then let them go on in error
        2. The world says to put them down and shame publicly
        3. That isn't love, but hate!
