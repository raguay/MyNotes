Matthew 13:52 "Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old."

1. A Taught Scribe
	1. Anyone that has been instructed by the Word of God
	2. Requires dilligent study of God's Word
		2 Timothy 2:15: 'Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.'
		1. All Christians are to be scribes instructed unto the kingdom of heaven
2. Householder
	1. One that owns a house
	2. We keep things precious to us in our house
	3. If we do not like it, we get rid of it 
3. Bring forth
	1. They are treasures
		1. Things that are dear to the householder
		2. He takes care of them and maintains them
	2. Bring forth means to show others
		1. We have something special, we do not want to keep it to ourselves
		2. We should want to show others as well
		3. This refers to teaching others what we have learned
			1. We should all be willing to teach others what we have learned. 
			2. Not just the pastor or preacher, but all Christians!
4. Old and New
	1. Sometimes it is something that we have already taught, but teaching it in a new way or light
	2. Giving a deaper meaning to that which has been taught
	3. And, sometimes showing something totally new
		1. New to us
		2. Nothing is totally new under the sun (in this world)
			Ecclesiastes 1:9: 'The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.'
	4. All of the Bible has one meaning, but endless application to our lives!
