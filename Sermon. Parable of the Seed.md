Mark 4:26-29 - Growth from a seed in the ground

1. Planting a seed in the ground
    1. Work the ground so that it is soft, not hard
    2. Add water and plant the seed
    3. Everyday, check to see if it needs water
2. The plant grows
    1. But, do you know how?
        1. The change is almost imperceptible at first
        2. Every plant changes at it's own pace
        3. But, change in coming or the seed dies
    2. The new plant looks nothing like the seed, but it is the same
        1. None of us are the same, but as we grow in Christ He changes us the same ways.
3. The mustard seed example - Mark 4:30-32
    1. A very small seed
    2. Creates a bigger plant than you would expect
        1. It's a vine like bush (พุ่มไม้ประเภทเถา) up to 20 ft (6.096m)
        2. Sometimes tall as well, but not normally
    3. But, uncharacteristic growth leads to an abnormal tree
        1. Mustard plants never get big enough for birds to lodge under
        2. Jesus is using it as an example of the Catholic church
            1. Starts really small by the Word of God
            2. Grows rapidly
            3. Then gets out of control
                1. Simply because of the church no longer following God but man
                2. Fowls of the air are evil spirits, doctrines of devils
                    - 1 Timothy 4:1 "Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
                    - 1ทิโมธี 4:1 "พระวิญญาณเตือนเรื่องคนจะละทิ้งความเชื่อบัดนี้ พระวิญญาณได้ตรัสไว้อย่างชัดแจ้งว่า ในกาลภายหลังจะมีบางคนละทิ้งความเชื่อ โดยหันไปเชื่อฟังวิญญาณที่ล่อลวง และฟังคำสอนของพวกผีปีศาจ"
                        1. The church was never meant by God to control Governments
                        2. When it starts to, it is following doctrines of devils
                            1. More evil is performed by that type of Government
