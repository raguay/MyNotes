Luke 15:11-32

1. The children of a father has privaleges
    1. They can use their relationship to get what they need
    2. The father is more than willing to give to his children
    3. But, they have to ask and receive it from their father
        1. If they follow after the father and show their love to the father, the easier it is to get answers
        2. A disobedient child doesn't get answers or often receive a swift "No"
            1. Not because the father is mean
            2. But, he knows that child will not follow his wishes.
            3. It is discipline to get the child willing to follow the father.
2. Man had two sons
    1. One obedient and did as his father asked
        1. The father said everything was his
        2. He could use his privalege as a son, but he didn't
            1. He just worked and in his heart was angry at his father
            2. Since he obeyed, he could use all that his father had
            3. But, he felt like he couldn't and just worked with bitterness.
    2. One, disobedient and wasted what his father gave him
        1. When in need, he can't simply ask his father
            1. He is no where near the father
            2. He knows the father is most likely angry with his choices
        2. He has to decide to leave his self willed life and ask to be made a servant of the father
            1. He has already thrown away his rights as a son
            2. He asks to be a servant
3. We are the son's of God
    - John 1:12 'But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:'
    - ยอห์น 1:12 "แต่ส่วนบรรดาผู้ที่ต้อนรับพระองค์ พระองค์ทรงประทานอำนาจให้เป็นบุตรของพระเจ้า คือคนทั้งหลายที่เชื่อในพระนามของพระองค์"
        1. When we accept Jesus as our only God and paid it all for all of our sins
            1. we become his children
            2. we have all rights and privileges as a son of God
                1. He has all power
                2. All riches
                3. So do we, But...
4. We often are like the man's two sons in the parable
    1. Disobedient
        1. Not near to God to ask for help
        2. Unwilling to submit to God, so God doesn't help us
            1. Too busy following our own ways to know what God wants for us.
        3. We throw away all rights and privileges of a son
    2. Obedient, but unwilling to ask
        1. We work for God and try our best to follow him
        2. But, we feel we aren't good enough to get help from God
        3. Actually, get mad at God for not just giving what we aren't willing to ask for.
        4. We forget what God said
            - 1 John 3:22 'And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.'
            - 1ยอห์น 3:22 "และเราขอสิ่งใดก็ตามเราก็จะได้สิ่งนั้นจากพระองค์ เพราะเรารักษาพระบัญญัติของพระองค์ และปฏิบัติสิ่งเหล่านั้นซึ่งเป็นที่พอพระทัยในสายพระเนตรของพระองค์"
    3. Often, going back and forth between the two extremes
        1. Disobedient and asking God for things
            1. God doesn't answer because we are far from Him
        2. Obedient, but quite
            1. Because God didn't come through when we asked before in disobedience.
            2. listening to the devil telling us that we aren't worthy enough because of our previous disobedience.
5. Let's do better than that man's two sons
    1. Be obedient and follow after God
        1. Submit to His will
        2. Fellowship with Him continuously
    2. Ask in faith know He will give because
        1. We are doing His will
        2. What we are asking is according to His will since that is what we are doing.
        3. God has forgiven all disobedience and wrong things we have done.
