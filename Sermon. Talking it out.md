Numbers 16:19-22 

1. God was having a bad day
   1. Even though He mightily rescued them from slavery, they were rebelling
      1. They wanted things their way
      2. They wanted an easy life without struggles
      3. Korah's family wanted to be as Aaron 
         1. They were not content with helping Aaron 
         2. They wanted to be the high priests
   2. Their constant complaining was too much
      1. Ten times before now they did not trust God's help
      2. They showed they wanted ease and comfort without seeking God
   3. God's first reaction was to destroy them
      1. It was what they deserve 
      2. God had every right to wipe them all out
      3. He did not require Moses and Aaron to get out of the way
         1. He could take care of the complainers without anyone's help
   4. But, God chose to talk to Moses and Aaron about it
      1. Told them to move out of His way
      2. This was signaling to Moses what He was going to do
      3. God knew Moses would talk to Him about it
   5. Moses and Aaron humbled themselves and asked for mercy
      1. They had no grounds other than love to ask
   6. God then just punished those that would not repent
      1. They already showed total and open defiance to God's authority
      2. They questioned God's judgements on others
      3. Their actions already proved what God knew from eternity. They would never walk with God!
2. We all have bad days
   1. Even God does
   2. But, instead of just reacting, we should talk it through
   3. Justice and equity is never served by quick decisions
3. Judgment still was served, but not in harshness but in Love
   1. We should talk things out before ever reacting
   2. Talking helps to but everything in perspective
   3. It doesn't mean to change that needs to be done, just helps to do it rightly
      1. It keeps us from just reacting and to think about it
