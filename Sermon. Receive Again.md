Colossians 3:23-25

1. Everything that we do
    1. Our daily activities
        1. Job, study, go to church, witnessing, etc
    2. We should do with our whole heart
        1. All of our ability and attention
        2. Not half heartly while dreaming of something else
        3. Not looking for ways out of doing what we are suppose to do
    3. As unto the Lord
        1. For we are His servants
            1. God created everyone to serve Him in love
            2. If we love someone, we willing do things that the person we love wants.
        2. We should be wanting to please Him
            1. It shows our love
            2. Is shows our respect to His authority in our lives
        3. Then we will be following Him
            1. Which causes us to lead others to Him
    4. Not to men
        1. Pleasing others distracts us from our higher purpose
            1. No one can please God and man at the same time
        2. Working to please men means we will not witness
            1. More afread of what they think than what is good for them
        3. Knowing it is for men
            1. We know they don't know everything
            2. Therefore, we can skip out or do as little as possible
                1. Until those in charge come around.
        4. This attitude, God says is sin
            1. Because it comes from laziness
2. As we work for God
    1. There is a reward
        1. Eternity with God
        2. No fear of hell
        3. God's blessings for walking with Him
    2. But if we do wrong
        1. Live and work for self and others
        2. Ignoring God's will and directions for our life
        3. Sinning due to not acknowledging God in our life
            1. Because He is rightfully Lord, not us
    3. We shall receive penalties for the wrong
        1. For the lost
            1. Eternity in Hell when they die
            2. They might enjoy life now, but an eternity of tormenting isn't fun!
        2. For the saved
            1. Loss of fellowship with God now
            2. Loss of things we need in life now
            3. Direct correction from God now
                - Hebrews 12:6 "For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth."
                - ฮีบรู 12:6 "เพราะองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าทรงตีสอนผู้ที่พระองค์ทรงรัก และเมื่อพระองค์ทรงรับผู้ใดเป็นบุตร พระองค์ก็ทรงเฆี่ยนตีผู้นั้น'"
    4. No respect of persons
        1. Everyone receives the same care: Christians and Lost people
            1. God doesn't respect anyone more than anyone else
                1. Everyone receives fair treatment from God
                2. Though men don't think it's fair, it is because has to be
                    1. Righteous
                    2. Just
                    3. Loving
            2. Just at different times
