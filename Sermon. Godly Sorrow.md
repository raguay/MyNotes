2 Corinthians 7:8-10

1. Paul rebuked the church's sin
    1. A man in the church married his father's wife (1 Corinthians 5:1)
        1. A sin that not even the lost world would do
    2. The church accepted the sin and rejoiced that Christians had such liberty
    3. Paul has a hard job to do
        1. No true preacher of God loves to rebuke someone
        2. But, God called Paul to make the church pure again
        3. Paul is rejoicing
            1. Not because of the rebuking
                1. Inflicting pain on someone is contrary to love
                2. But, as the doctor causes pain for the paitent to heal, the preacher has to tell it as it is to help the church
            2. But, because the church and the man repented with godly sorrow
2. Two types of sorrow
    1. Sorry that you got caught and have a punishment - Worldly Sorrow
        1. Esau sorrowed greatly for selling his inheretance
            - Hebrews 12:17 "For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears."
            - ฮีบรู 12:17 "เพราะท่านทั้งหลายก็รู้อยู่แล้วว่า ต่อมาภายหลังเมื่อเอซาวอยากได้รับพรนั้นเป็นมรดก เขาก็ได้รับคำปฏิเสธ เพราะเขาไม่มีหนทางแก้ไขเลย ถึงแม้ว่าได้กลับใจแสวงหาจนน้ำตาไหล"
                1. He only sorrowed that he lost the blessing
                2. He still did not care for the heavenly inheretance
        2. Like most children when they get a spanking
            1. They cry over the pain, not that they did wrong
    2. Sorry that you did wrong - Godly Sorrow
        1. Happens when you are really sorry for the wrong
            1. You really want to change
        2. Problems is: our hearts deceive us
            - Jeremiah 17:9 "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?"
            - เยเรมีย์ 17:9 "จิตใจก็เป็นตัวล่อลวงเหนือกว่าสิ่งใดทั้งหมด มันเสื่อมทรามอย่างร้ายทีเดียว ผู้ใดจะรู้จักใจนั้นเล่า"
2. How do you sorrow?
    1. Worldly sorrow gets you no where!
    2. Godly sorrow gives true repentance and forgiveness!
