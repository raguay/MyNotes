Luke 4:1-2, 14

1. Jesus needed time of separation
    1. After baptized, in wilderness 40 day/nights
    2. Then he was tempted of the devil
    3. Afterwards, he was imbued with power
        1. To preach the Gospel and do God's work
2. Others also had similar experiences
    1. Moses 
        1.  He was up on a mountain 40 day/nights twice
            1. Getting the commandments of God
            2. Used that time in talking with God
        2. Afterwards, as able to lead Israel in wilderness
    2. David
        1. While Saul was chasing him
            1. He and his men were in the wilderness
        2. Afterwards, was able to be an effective king in Israel
    3. Elijah
        1. While the famine was in the land, he was alone near a stream
        2. Then, he was with a widow and her son
        3. Then, he led the great Mount Carmel revival!
3. God can use "wilderness" times in our lives
    1. Bring us closer to Him
        1. More time to pray, read the Bible
        2. A chance to place our trust in Him more by
            1. Not being fearful
            2. Not worrying
    2. Afterwards, enabling us to do more work for Him
        1. Each time someone in the Bible had a "wilderness", they were able to do more for God!
        2. It takes accepting the time and making the best use of the time
4. We just have to accept it and make the best of it
    1. Whining, complaining, fearfulness keep us from making the best use of the experience for growth.
