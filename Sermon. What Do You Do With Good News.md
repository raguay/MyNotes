Luke 2:17-20

1. A lot has happened
    1. Joseph and Mary arrived in Bethlehem
    2. Jesus was born
    3. Angels appeared to the shepherds
        1. Praising God
        2. Told of Jesus' birth
    4. Shepards went to visit Joseph, Mary, and baby Jesus
    5. Wise men came to visit
    6. All of this most likely took the whole night
        1. They returned to their sheep in the morning
            1. Because, they had to tend to the sheep's needs
        2. They met others on the way back to their sheep
2. What would some people do with it all?
    1. Keep it to themselves
        1. Others would just think that they were crazy
    2. Tell just a few close friends
    3. Tell some, but the first negative reaction causes them to keep quiet the rest of their lives.
3. What did the shepherds do?
    1. They returned to where they came from
        1. The sheep would need to be led to water
        2. Then they needed to be taken to a new area to eat
        3. They had to fulfill their responsibilities.
    2. They praised God all along the way back
    3. They told all that passed by the what had happened
        1. Since it was morning, people were up and around
        2. There was many that heard from the shepherds
        3. All wondered at what the shepherds told them
4. But, what are you doing?
    1. You have the full story and have experienced the new birth in Christ
        1. He washed your sins away
        2. He gave you the Holy Spirit to direct you
        3. You have an eternal home in heaven,  not hell!
    2. Are you declaring it like the shepherds?
