Psalms 28:3-5

1. Wicked People
    1. They aren't bad people in men's eyes
        1. They speak peace
            - friendly
            - helpful even
        2. Mostly are respectable in their communities
        3. Some aren't respectable
        4. But, they are really bad in God’s eyes
	        1. Because mischief is in their hearts.
    2. God declares that he will 
        1. destroy them
            1. God gives them up to their judgment
                1. Hell for eternity
                2. often waiting for their normal death, but sometimes helps it along.
        2. not build them up
            2. Whatever they get in life is by their own means
            3. God is not helping them at all
2. The reason that God calls them that
    1. They regard not the works of the Lord
        1. God created everything for all mankind
            1. When we selfishly use it, we are not considering why God made it and for what purpose.
        2. God is maintaining everything
            1. Until the end of time
        3. God creates each person
            1. If God was not creating, no one could have a baby.
            2. They are God's gift. 
                - Psalms 127:3 'Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the womb is his reward.'
                - สดุดี 127:3 "บุตรที่ดีเป็นของประทานจากพระเจ้าดูเถิด บุตรทั้งหลายเป็นมรดกจากพระเยโฮวาห์ ผู้บังเกิดจากครรภ์เป็นรางวัลของพระองค์"
            3. But people often refer to them as a burden, curse.
                - Isaiah 5:20: 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!'
                - อิสยาห์ 5:20 "วิบัติแก่คนเหล่านั้นที่เรียกความชั่วร้ายว่าความดี และความดีว่าความชั่วร้าย ผู้ถือเอาว่าความมืดเป็นความสว่าง และความสว่างเป็นความมืด ผู้ถือเอาว่าความขมเป็นความหวาน และความหวานเป็นความขม"
    2. regard not the operations of his hands
        1. God is working in everyone's life to bring them to Him
            1. God said we never look to God ourselves
            2. it is the operation of His hands to bring us to Him
            3. But, many think they came to church by their own decision
        2. God is working in everyone's life to make them successful
            1. A father never seeks the destruction of a child!
            2. He wants whats best for us, but we ignore him
            3. often taking credit for ourselves
        3. God is telling us about sin we are about to commit
            1. But, do you shrug it off and still do it
3. Is that you?
	1. You don't have to be lost to be this type of person.
		1. But, you can be lost.
		2. Make sure of your salvation
	2. Just repent and look to Jesus for direction each day!
		1. Take notice of what God is doing for you and wants you to do!
