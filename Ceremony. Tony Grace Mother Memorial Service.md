1. We all have but one life
    1. God gives us all the same opportunity to live
        1. Many live good long lives with many great achivements
            - Gladys was a great opra singer
            - Blessed many with her great voice.
        2. Everyone influences others by their lives
            - Tony loves opra due to his mother's talents
    2. Man's inhumanity to man is what cheats some out of it
    3. Accidents also shorten other lives
    4. But, after our life, we all face God, Jesus Christ
        - 2 Corinthians 5:10 "For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."

            2. God sends people with the Gospel message
                - All sinners can receive forgiveness of all sins
                - Fully paid by Jesus' blood
        2. Those that accept Jesus as the one and only God
            1. They are accepted into heaven
            2. They are rewarded for their service to Jesus
        3. Those that trust something else
            1. A burning lake of fire for the rest of eternity
2. What has our life been like?
