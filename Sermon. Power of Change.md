Ephesians 1:3-6,13-14

1. All blessings come from God v.3
    1. Salvation by faith v13
        1. Someone witnessed to you
        2. God worked faith in your heart
        3. God then sealed you by the Holy Spirit forever v 13-14
    2. He works His holiness in us v4-5
        1. It's by His design before the world
        2. Those that trust in Him, He conforms us to His image
        3. Not us trying to be holy or righteous
2. It happens for His praise, honor, and glory v6
    1. If we get honor, it wasn't God's work
    2. There is nothing we can do, it has to be all God
3. Each verse uses a greek work derived from the same work for dynamite (ระเบิด)
    1. It's a great power that only God can do
    2. It is the changes to our nature
        1. Like making a tiger totally tame
        2. Nothing on this earth can do it, it still has the same violent tendencies
