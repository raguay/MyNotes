Matthew 12:43-45
Luke 11:24-26

1. A person is daemon possessed
    1. Every lost person can be controlled by daemon
        1. It doesn't mean they can't control themselves
        2. They are continually manipulated by them
    2. Lost people have no protection from daemons
2. He gets saved or religious
    1. Straightens up and gets right with God
        1. Real or fake
        2. They at least draw near to God which drives away the daemon
    2. Then, they go back to old sin habits
        1. Sin is what gives Satan power over our lives
3. The daemon comes back
    1. In a war, the enemy never gives up
        1. He is constantly looking for a way to get you
        2. We have to be vigilant
            - 1 Peter 5:8 "Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:"
            - 1เปโตร 5:8 "ท่านทั้งหลายจงเป็นคนใจหนักแน่น จงระวังระไวให้ดี ด้วยว่าศัตรูของท่าน คือพญามาร วนเวียนอยู่รอบๆดุจสิงโตคำราม เที่ยวไปเสาะหาคนที่มันจะกัดกินได้"
    2. Straight and in order, but empty
        1. They aren't walking with God
        2. God isn't the one directing their lives
        3. So, it's just them in a clean house
    3. He goes and finds seven more daemons worse than him
        1. They work together to really make the person's life a mess
4. We are in a war and we can't afford to be slack
    1. To keep Satan at bay, we need to stay close to God
