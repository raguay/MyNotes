Psalms 37:5 "Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass."
สดุดี 37:5 "จงมอบทางของท่านไว้กับพระเยโฮวาห์ วางใจในพระองค์ และพระองค์จะทรงกระทำให้สำเร็จ"

1. Commit your way unto the Lord
    1. The Hebrew word is "to roll"
    2. Illustration
        1. A big round stone (marble) and a path for it down a hill
        2. Once you start it in the path
            1. It follows it all down the hill
            2. You can't stop it
            3. It does bump around the path, but ultimately stays in it
        3. The ball is your life, the path is the Lord's way
            1. Roll your life along God's way and he keeps it there
            2. He brings the life path to it's end, heaven
            3. You can't stop it, but it will bump around a lot! 
            4. Even if you bump out, God will get it back in, but it's not the best way.
2. Trust also in Him
    1. You have to believe and trust his path is the best thing for your life
    2. It's a trust that says
        1. Even if the "bumps are hard" I'll stay with it
        2. Thinking of leaving it if it goes bad or hard isn't trusting!
3. He will bring it to pass
    1. God gives the best life/path that is before you
    2. Your best will always be less than God's, no matter what it looks like to us
    3. And, of course, the end is in heaven no matter how bumpy!
