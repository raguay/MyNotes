Matthew 10:27 "What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops."

มัทธิว 10:27 "ซึ่งเรากล่าวแก่พวกท่านในที่มืด ท่านจงกล่าวในที่สว่าง และซึ่งท่านได้ยินกระซิบที่หู ท่านจงประกาศจากดาดฟ้าหลังคาบ้าน"

1. Jesus talks to us
   1. He emphatically declares that he is talking to us
      - Job 33:14-16
         1. It's a real thing that God is talking to us
         2. Like Isaiah, we have to listen (Isaiah 6)
            1. Unconfessed sin keeps us from listening
            2. Not willing to follow keeps us from listening
         3. It's our responsibility to listen to him
            1. You can't hear Jesus because you aren't listening to Jesus
            2. It's not God's problem, it's ours
               1. Our heart has to be willing to receive direction
               2. We have to be willing to follow whenever He leads us
            3. God isn't going to force you listen to Him.
               1. He wants us to choose to listen to Him out of love.
2. Talks to us in darkness
   1. In private time of studying His word and prayer
   2. He is expecting us to take time talking and listening to Him
      1. Without distractions
      2. It's a really private time with God
3. Talks to us in our ears
   1. As we go about our day
   2. Jesus is talking to us in our ears
      1. Showing us who to witness too.
      2. We are to preach to them publicly and boldly
      3. We should not keep it to ourselves
   3. Since we are busy with life
      1. We have to work hard to listen to Him
      2. We have to think about Jesus and what He wants
      3. Or, we have unconfessed sin that is keeping us from hearing or even still lost
         1. Get right with God!
4. Are you listening to Jesus?
