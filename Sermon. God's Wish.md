Deuteronomy 5:22-29 "...I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they have well said all that they have spoken. O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children for ever!"

1. Israel at Mount Sinai
   1. God spoke to them out of the fire
   2. Israel was scared to hear God's voice
   3. They asked Moses to listen to God and tell them afterwards
   4. God heard the request
      1. He agreed
         1. because, they really didn't want to follow Him
         2. They wanted someone to be close to God 
         3. they just wanted to get the blessings
      2. By God's responce we see
         1. They people didn't really want to follow God
         2. They want the advantages of following God while doing their own will.
2. God's wish
   1. Everyone had it in their heart to
      1. Fear Him
      2. Keep His commandments
      3. So that He could bless them and their children
