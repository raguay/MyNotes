Jeremiah 35:1-19

1. The Rechabites family
   1. Jonadab the son of Rechab commanded
      1. Don't drink wine
      2. Don't build houses or fields
      3. Dwell in tents
      4. He commanded 300 years before Jeremiah preached this message
   2. Jonadab saw that Israel
      1. Wasn't following God always
      2. God would bring judgment as he saw in the days of King Jehu
         1. Just as he saw God judge King Ahab
         2. He knew Israel would not escape judgment
      3. Wine leads to bad judgment
         1. The Kings of Syria attacking Ahab failed because they were drunk
         2. He didn't want his children to have bad judgment
      4. Houses and fields keep you from moving when trouble comes
         1. trouble comes, just move
         2. Easy to move when you live in tents
         3. It's a life knowing that their real home isn't here
         4. Loving their "things" makes them more vulnerable to problems
   3. God blesses them for their obedience
      1. They would be safe through the coming trail
         1. Babylon was going to destroy all of Israel
         2. They would be safe during the wars
      2. They would always have a member of their family as a witness upon the earth.
         1. Jewish custom says that there are people from that family until this day.
2. God has instructed us as well.
   1. Our heavenly Father asks us to
      - Deuteronomy 10:12 "And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,"
      - พระราชบัญญัติ 10:12 "และบัดนี้ คนอิสราเอล พระเยโฮวาห์พระเจ้าของท่านทรงประสงค์ให้ท่านกระทำอย่างไร คือให้ยำเกรงพระเยโฮวาห์พระเจ้าของท่าน ให้ดำเนินตามพระมรรคาทั้งปวงของพระองค์ ให้รักพระองค์ ให้ปรนนิบัติพระเยโฮวาห์พระเจ้าของท่านด้วยสุดจิตสุดใจของท่านทั้งหลาย"
         1. Fear the Lord God
            - Proverbs 8:13 "The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate."
            - สุภาษิต 8:13 "ความยำเกรงพระเยโฮวาห์เป็นความเกลียดชังความชั่วร้าย เราเกลียดความเย่อหยิ่งและความจองหอง และทางของความชั่วร้ายกับปากตลบตะแลง"
               1. If you fear God, you will hate evil
               2. People do evil because they don't fear God's judgment 
         2. Walk with Him
         3. Love Him enough to server Him with all your heart
3. Are we as obedient as the Rechabites
	1. Doing what God wants us to do
		1. Out of love for God, not duty to the preacher
	2. Teaching our children, grandchildren to do the same
		1. Being a good example in front of them
		2. Telling them to do the same
