Luke 10:27-37
1. Focus here is on loving your neighbor
    1. The world wants to redefine neighbor
        1. Just those people you are comfortable with
        2. Those that are like you
        3. Relatives and friends
    2. But, Jesus gives the right definition
        1. Everyone, even enemies, that we meet
    3. Jesus illustrates it with a story
        1. A jew travels from Jerusalem to Jericho (20 miles, 32 kilometers)
        2. Robbers almost kill him
            1. Very common there
            2. Often has been called "the bloody road"
        3. Religious people just walk past him
            1. A priest and a Levi
            2. Their 'rules' of purity say that they need to just pass him by
                1. They can't be defiled before performing their duties
                2. They justify themselves instead of showing love
        4. A Samaritan helps him
          1. All Jews hate Samaritans because they are half Jew
          2. A Jew would never help or talk to a Samaritan
          3. But, the Samaritan shows love by helping the man that can't help himself
2. Loving those around you
    1. Seeing they have a problem
        1. They are lost without Christ
    2. Seeing that you can help them
        1. You know Christ and can lead them to Him
    3. Help them with the problem
        1. Tell them how to know Christ and be saved from their sins
3. Anything short of that is hating your neighbor
    1. And therefore, breaks the second commandment
    2. And the first since Christ said
        - Mark 16:15 "And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature."
        - มาระโก 16:15 "ฝ่ายพระองค์จึงตรัสสั่งพวกสาวกว่า "ท่านทั้งหลายจงออกไปทั่วโลกประกาศข่าวประเสริฐแก่มนุษย์ทุกคน"
