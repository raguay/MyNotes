John 16:16-28

1. The disciples had a question about God's Word - What Jesus was saying
	1. Jesus had said "in a little while...." (อีกหน่อยท่านทั้งหลายก็จะไม่เห็นเรา)
	2. They did not understand what Jesus was talking about
2. Jesus explains
	1. They will have sorrow and confusion because of His death
	2. He has been using proverbs (คำอุปมา), but not anymore
		1. From now on, Jesus speaks plainly to his followers
	3. He is going to the Father and will come back to them
		1. They still did not fully understand that he would die and resurrect
		2. They most likely thought that Jesus was just going to ask the Father for them
3. Jesus telling them to ask
	1. Asking isn't a blank check for anything we want
		1. Here, He is only talking about knowing the Word of God
		2. But, his application is to all things we need to fulfill the task He gives us
		3. God never just gives us anything we ask for
			1. But only that which fulfills His will and plans
	2. In Jesus' name
		1. Which means, according to His will
			1. Just adding "in Jesus' name" isn't enough
			2. It has to be as though Jesus himself is asking
		2. To ask something in someone's name is to have their
			1. Approval
			2. Authority
			3. In accordance to their will
		3. Like a servant buying supplies in the land owner's name
			1. The land owner is the one paying for it all
			2. The servant gets it like the landowner himself was buying it
	3. They haven't been asking for explanations much, just some
		1. A few of the proverbs had the disciples asked for a meaning
			1. Sower of the seed parables
	4. Jesus is here declaring that they should ask about everything in the Bible
		1. Don't try to figure it out yourself
		2. Go to God for understanding of the Word
	5. He gives the firm promise, God will give it!
		- James 1:5 "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."
		- ยากอบ 1:5 "ถ้าผู้ใดในพวกท่านขาดสติปัญญา ก็ให้ผู้นั้นทูลขอจากพระเจ้า ผู้ทรงโปรดประทานให้แก่คนทั้งปวงอย่างเหลือล้นและมิได้ทรงตำหนิ และจะทรงประทานให้แก่ผู้นั้น"
			1. It will be plain
			2. It will be easy to explain to others because we fully understand
			3. He gives the knowledge because He loves us as a Father
				1. A good father always wants to teach his children the right path
