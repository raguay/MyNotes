2 Timothy 4:1-5

1. Itching Ears
	1. They want teaching that is:
		1. easy
		2. doesn't point out sin
		3. doesn't point out responsibility
	2. When they do not get it
		1. They talk about the preacher
		2. go to other churches more acceptable to them
	3. Their main problem
		1. They want to be their own boss
		2. They want life their way
		3. not really interested in God
			1. Except to help out in problems
			2. Wanting to use God, not be used by God
2. But, they most likely did not start that way
	1. They let life get bigger than God in their eyes.
	2. They never trusted in Him
	3. They want wowed more than worked
	4. They quit praying for the preacher to stay close to God!
3. So, God says to 
	1. Preach the word!
		1. Only path to healing is by 
			1. Hearing the truth
			2. Trust in God working it out through you
			3. Surrender to God instead of trying to:
				1. make excuses
				2. blame others
				3. fixing it your way
