Philippians 3:8-10

1. Our Goals
   1. Everyone has goals in their lives
      1. Many have the goal of self-righteousness
      2. Many have the goal of satisfaction
      3. Many have the goal of self-sufficient
   2. Those that have no goals are having problems
        - Proverbs 29:18 "Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he."
        - สุภาษิต 29:18 "ที่ใดๆที่ไม่มีนิมิต ประชาชนก็พินาศ แต่คนที่รักษาพระราชบัญญัติจะเป็นสุข"
    			1. If we have no goals, life is useless and therefore perishing
    			2. A true life is always increasing more and more
    3. But Paul's goal was Jesus	
2. Before seeking Jesus
	1. Forget past accomplishments
	2. Forget past experiences
	3. See the past as imperfect and not complete
		1. Never look upon past accomplishments as defining your future
		2. God is always wanting to make the future better with more of His power in it as we yield to His will.
	4. Then look for Jesus	
		1. Not comforts
		2. Not ease
		3. Not fun
		4. Not status
		5. But, for His goals for our lives
3. The goal is to:
	1. Know Him
		1. Not to know of Him, but to really know God personally in your life
		2. It only happens to a life surrendered to His will
	2. The power of His resurrection
		1. His resurrection power gives us power to overcome sin and all difficulties.
	3. The fellowship of His sufferings
		1. We don't look for problems and rejoice in problems
			1. Problems are natural by product of living in a fallen world
		2. We rejoice that as we do face the problems, Christ is comforting us and helping us.
