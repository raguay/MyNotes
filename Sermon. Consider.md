 2 Timothy 2:7 "Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things."
2 ทิโมธี 2:7 "จงใคร่ครวญถึงสิ่งที่ข้าพเจ้าได้พูดเถิด ด้วยองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าจะทรงประทานความเข้าใจให้แก่ท่านในทุกสิ่ง"

1. Paul's last letter to Timothy
    1. Timothy is discuraged by so many Christians turning away from the Gospel message
        1. Not witnessing
        2. Not attending church
        3. More worried about their life than serving God
            1. Neo, ruler in Rome, was burning Christians alive tied to poles in his yard
            2. The Jews were actively seeking Christians to kill them.
            3. Many were dying just because they trusted in Jesus or witnessing.
    2. Paul is writing these things to help him
        1. But, ultimately, God has to do the work in him.
2. Consider what I say
    1. Takes these words, all of them, and think about them
        1. It's not idol reading
        2. It is reading carefully and multiple times
        3. Paul is referring to all the letters he has written
            1. God is directing us to conside all of His Word
    2. Make them a part of your life
        1. It is the same as when we talk to our parents or someone we respect about what we should do
        2. We listen very carefully and go over it in our mind
        3. We then take action based on it
            1. If you don't plan to take action, you will not consider it
3. Realizing who gives us understanding and wisdom
    1. God gives us the ability to understand and apply His word to our lives.
        - James 1:5: 'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.'
        - ยากอบ 1:5 'ถ้าผู้ใดในพวกท่านขาดสติปัญญา ก็ให้ผู้นั้นทูลขอจากพระเจ้า ผู้ทรงโปรดประทานให้แก่คนทั้งปวงอย่างเหลือล้นและมิได้ทรงตำหนิ และจะทรงประทานให้แก่ผู้นั้น'
    2. But here, it's talking about how to apply it to our lives
        1. There are many ways to apply the knowledge God gives us from His Word
        2. We have to look to God for the right way to apply it for each situation.
            - 1 Corinthians 6:12: 'All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.'
            - 1 โคริน 6:12 'ข้าพเจ้าทำสิ่งสารพัดได้ แต่ไม่ใช่ทุกสิ่งที่จะทำได้นั้นเป็นประโยชน์ ข้าพเจ้าทำสิ่งสารพัดได้ แต่ข้าพเจ้าไม่ยอมอยู่ใต้อำนาจของสิ่งใดเลย'
                1. Some people will take this verse and drink alchohol
                    1. They think "it can't control me"
                    2. In the end, their lives are ruined due to arguments, lost work, etc. because of drinking
                2. They did not consider the verse and allow God to show them how to apply it to their lives.
                    1. They are just using God's Word to justify their sins.
