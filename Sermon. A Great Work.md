Nehemiah 6:1-3

Built the wall in 52 days.

1. Called of God to work
    1. God wants everyone to be busy
        1. God condemns laziness
            - 2 Thessalonians 3:10 "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
            - 2เธสะโลนิกา 3:10 "แม้เมื่อเราอยู่กับพวกท่าน เราก็ได้กำชับท่านอย่างนี้ว่า ถ้าผู้ใดไม่ยอมทำงาน ก็อย่าให้เขากิน"
                1. Even the poor in the Old Testament days had to glean grain from the field themselves that others left behind.
                2. God never asks us to just give the poor daily food
                3. Even when we ask for our daily bread, God will give us work to get it.
    2. We are to work
        1. Adam and Eve worked
        2. Noah worked
        3. Abraham worked
        4. etc.
	3. God has a job for everyone since we are servants of God.
2. Get the job done
    1. He did not stop until the work was done.
    2. No matter the obstacle, get the job done!
	    1. People yell at you, keep going.
	    2. People attack you, keep going.
	3. God is greater than all of our obstacles
		- 1 John 4:4 "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world."
		- 1ยอห์น 4:4 "ลูกเล็กๆทั้งหลายเอ๋ย ท่านเป็นฝ่ายพระเจ้า และได้ชนะเขาเหล่านั้น เพราะว่าพระองค์ผู้สถิตอยู่ในท่านทั้งหลายเป็นใหญ่กว่าผู้นั้นที่อยู่ในโลก"
3. Stay with it no matter what the world says
    1. The world will try to convince you that
        1. God changed his mind
        2. The task is too hard
        3. You aren't qualified
        4. You are needed elsewhere
    2. God gives a command, only God can change it
	    1. If God hasn't moved you from a job, keep at it.
	    2. But, if God says to change, that is when you change your job!
		    1. He's the boss!
4. Therefore, are we working?
	1. On God's work? Or our own?
