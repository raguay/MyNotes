Nehemiah 6:1-3

Built the wall in 52 days.

1. Called of God to work
    1. God wants everyone to be busy
        1. God condemns laziness
            - 2 Thessalonians 3:10 "For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
            - 2เธสะโลนิกา 3:10 "แม้เมื่อเราอยู่กับพวกท่าน เราก็ได้กำชับท่านอย่างนี้ว่า ถ้าผู้ใดไม่ยอมทำงาน ก็อย่าให้เขากิน"
                1. Even the poor in the Old Testament days had to glean grain from the field themselves that other left behind.
                2. God never asks us to just give daily food
    2. We are to work
        1. Adam and Eve worked
        2. Noah worked
        3. Abraham worked
        4. etc.
2. Get the job done
    1. He did not stop until the work was done.
    2. No matter the obstacle, get the job done!
3. Stay with it no matter what the world says
    1. The world will try to convince you that
        1. God changed his mind
        2. The task is too hard
        3. You aren't qualified
        4. You are needed elsewhere
    2. God gives a command, only God can change it
