Isaiah 26:3 "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee."

อิสยาห์ 26:3 "ใจแน่วแน่ในพระองค์นั้น พระองค์ทรงรักษาไว้ในสันติภาพอันสมบูรณ์ เพราะเขาวางใจในพระองค์"

1. We all want peace
   1. Free from worries
   2. Free from fears
   3. Free from doubts
   4. Free from anger
2. But, true peace never comes from us or others
   1. Others seem to take away our peace more than give it
   2. Peace we find in others is always short lived.
3. Peace is only in God, Jesus
   1. Keeping our minds thinking upon Him
      1. Who comes to mind first when something good or bad happens
      2. That is who you are thinking about the most
   2. We always think about that which we trust
      1. Little kids often think about parents
      2. They know they will protect them
      3. They know they will provide for them
