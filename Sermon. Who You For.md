Joshua 5:13-15

1. God uses Joshua to lead Israel into the land of promise.
	1. They are right before the city of Jericho
	2. The city is large and closed up
		1. Very hard to fight.
	3. Joshua is thinking about what to do
		1. When a man on a horse appears
		2. He has a sword in his hand to fight
	4. Joshua asks the question
		1. Are you for us or our enemies
		2. For Joshua, there is just two sides
			1. Israel
				1. The people God promised the land too
			2. Jericho
				1. Outsiders that took the land before God's promise could be fulfilled
	5. The man says "Nay", but for God's army!
		1. This basically means, he's not taking sides (ไม่เข้าข้าง)
		2. He's not for Israel nor Jericho
			1. But, he is for the Lord's will to be done with his army! 
2. Taking sides
	1. By our nature, we take sides in a dispute
		1. We always believe someone is right and the others are wrong.
	2. God doesn't
		1. With all knowledge of past and future events, God only cares for the final outcome
		2. Everything He decides is correct and best.
3. Who's side are you on?
	1. We shouldn't be trying to figure out who is right and wrong.
		1. Taking a side just increases:
			1. the problems
			2. the arguments
			3. the hurt feelings
		2. We need to surrender to God's control and direction for our actions
			1. Then God will defend us!
	2. We should be on God's side and let Him decide on what to do
		1. When we can honestly say God directed our path, others can't fight with us or be mad at us.
			1. Anything less means others and/or ourselves are fight against God.
			2. Fighting against God will always be a losing battle!
		2. God knows how to defend us and help us.
