Description of Work:

We have two services in Thai on Sunday (10:00am-12:30pm and 6:30pm - 7:30pm) with English translation as needed. During the school year, we have a service at the Welfare School every Sunday at 3:00pm - 4:30pm. We also have a Wednesday service at 6:30pm to 7:30pm.

We have Burmese service every Thursday night at 7:00pm to 8:00pm at the Five Crossings location on a pig farm. I've had to cancel this one often due to my asthma acting up bad with the pollution and dust during the dry season. We have a Saturday Evening Service in Burmese at 7:00pm to 8:30pm.

We have an English Service every Friday night at 7:00pm to 8:30pm with a meal.

We teach English with a Bible lessen in three local schools. We also have a English class with Bible lessen every Saturday at 4:00pm to 5:00pm.

I'm currently training Naut to be a pastor. We have Bible classes during the week.

We have Saturday tract distribution in the mornings.

We are currently actively building a new church building.

But, most of this has been canceled due to the Corona virus pandemic. We are having all of the Sunday and Wednesday services by Facebook Live. We are still visiting our blind lady, Bumi, that attends because she is very lonely.

Budget: 

The members' tithe have been paying the electricity bill, water bill, the Sunday afternoon meal together, and part of the rent. Richard Guay is paying for the rest with his support.
