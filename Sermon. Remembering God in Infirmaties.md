Psalms 77:10-14

1. We all have infirmaties
    1. We are earthen vessels
        - 2 Corinthians 4:7 "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us."
        - 2โครินธ์ 4:7 ""ทรัพย์สมบัติในภาชนะดิน"แต่ว่าเรามีทรัพย์สมบัตินี้อยู่ในภาชนะดิน เพื่อให้เห็นว่าฤทธิ์เดชอันเลิศนั้นเป็นของพระเจ้า ไม่ได้มาจากตัวเราเอง"
            1. Earthen vessels break really easily
                1. Physical weakness
                2. Mental weakness
                3. We really aren't equipt to handle these things.
    2. When others see us accomplish more
        1. The earthen vessel couldn't of done it
        2. God is clearly shown to the whole world
2. The thing is, we can't let the infirmaties define us
    1. We often say no to God because 
        1. we know were not able to do it ourselves
        2. we remember our past failures and say the future isn't possible
    2. We rob God and ourselves of what we could do
        1. We let the past define our future
        2. God doesn't work like that and neither should we
3. Remember what God has done
    1. The years of the right hand of the Lord
        1. Think about How God has helped in the past
        2. The days when you seemed to walk with God easily
    2. His works and wonders of Old
    3. Meditate on what God has done
        1. For others
        2. For you
    4. Tell others of what God has done
        1. We declare his strength among the people
        2. Notice, we do the declare but God's word said He did
        3. No one declares the great work of God and give God all the credit without God working in their heart
