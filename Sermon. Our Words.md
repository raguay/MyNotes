ยากอบ 5:12 "พี่น้องทั้งหลายของข้าพเจ้า ที่สำคัญยิ่งกว่าสิ่งอื่นใดก็คือ จงอย่าปฏิญาณ อย่าอ้างฟ้าสวรรค์หรือแผ่นดินโลก หรือคำปฏิญาณอื่นๆ แต่ที่ควรว่าใช่ก็จงว่าใช่ ที่ควรว่าไม่ก็จงว่าไม่ เพื่อท่านจะไม่ถูกลงโทษ"

Judges 11:29-31,34 - Jephthah's oath & daughter

1. We should only speak what we really mean
    1. We often say something shorter to save breath, but gives the wrong idea to others
    2. We need to speak exactly what we mean and then do it
        1. To say something and not perform it is sin and very hurtful to others
    3. Examples:
        1. Promise child to perform an activity
            1. We mean to say "if I can", but we don't
            2. We just say we will do it
            3. When we can't, we feel they should just get over it as that is how life is, but it is wrong for us.
        2. Promising God we will be faithful if.......
            1. But, we never do what we say
            2. Or we do it even though it is wrong or hurtful to others
            3. We expect God to "understand" and go on, often without thinking about it at all
            4. Our kids see this and become non-believers
2. God called Jephthah to defeat Israel's enemy the Ammonites
    1. He does it just as God called him to do
    2. But, just as he is beginning to fight, he declares his oath to God
        1. Whatever comes out of his house, he will give to God a burnt offering
        2. The houses then had the animals living in the front of the house with everyone else in the back of the house.
            1. Enemies coming would encounter the animals and the noise would alert them
            2. The animals help block the cold weather from coming to the family
        3. Jephthah just assumed one of the animals would come out before his only daughter did.
        4. He goes ahead and burns his daughter to God
            1. It wasn't God's will or desire
            2. God has never nor never will sanction human sacrifice.
            3. He tested Abraham, but never allowed him to do it!
        5. Israel's women begin to worship his daughter
            1. Every year they would mourn for her (v. 40)
            2. It became a false worship and a great sin to the whole country
3. Jephthah sinned by making the unnecessary oath
    1. God had already called him to win
    2. He needed nothing else but God's will for his life
    3. But, he wanted to have a part by making the oath
    4. God still did what He intended to do all along
        1. It had nothing to do with the oath
    5. The bible doesn't record anything else about Jephthah
        1. God couldn't use him anymore after this
