Matthew 13:24-30

1. Good man planted wheat
	1. The story is
		1. He used good seed
		2. He watch over it okay
		3. But, while he slept, the enemy sowed tares (weeds)
			1. A tare in the Bible is a weed that looks very similar to wheat 
			2. When grown, they start to look different
	2. The meaning is
		1. The seed is the Word of God
		2. The good man is God (Jesus)
		3. The enemy is the Devil
		4. But what are the tares?
			1. Most preachers teach that they are lost people
				1. But nothing really says that except that the Devil planted them
				2. But the Devil can and does use saved but disobedient Christians
			2. We first need to understand what wheat is.
2. The wheat
	1. They are born of the Word of God
		1. So they are true Christians
		2. They are saved by faith and not by works
		3. But they know that their life isn't their own
			- Galatians 2:20: 'I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.'
		4. They practice walking after the Spirit of God
			1. But no one is perfect, because "All have sinned and come short of the glory of God." - Romans 3:23
			2. They practice everyday to follow the Spirit
				- Galatians 5:16: 'This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.'
					1. We can live sinless by walking with God daily and doing his will
					2. No one can do it always, but we should try!
3. The tares
	1. Since the tares are opposite of wheat, there are two types
		1. Lost people 
			1. Since they do not know God, they can't walk with God
			2. They often can look like good Christians
				1. But their faith is in something other than Jesus and what He did for us.
				2. Or, they just want to use God for salvation.
					1. They never wanted to follow after God
					2. They want out of Hell, but they don't want a King ruling them - Luke 19:27
				3. Many simply follow "religion" and assume everything is okay.
					1. Dad and Mom did it this way, why not them
					2. They are just simply following "tradition"
		2. Disobedient Christians
			1. These are those who truly trust Jesus and wants to follow Jesus
			2. But, they allow the cares of the world to distract them from what they should do
				1. Follow other "Christians" they see
				2. Following their friends that aren't Christians
				3. Following the philosophies of this world
			3. Others simply don't want to work for Christ
				- Ephesians 4:11 "And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
					1. God gives people in the church to work
					2. Pew sitting isn't a job
					3. Everyone should be working
						1. Apostles - missionaries
						2. prophets - pastors and teachers of God's word
						3. Evangelists - people witnessing to other
						4. pastors and teachers 
					4. The least everyone can do is witness
						- Mark 16:15: 'And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.'
			4. Disobedient Christians are saved by fire
				- 1 Corinthians 3:15: 'If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.'
					1. Everything they thought they did for Christ is just burned up
					2. Just like the lost being through to the Lake of Fire
4. Who are you?
