Dear {Name},

During this holiday season, I would like to reflect on why we celerbrate it. Around 2,000 years ago, God became a man to rescue everyone who accepts Him as their one and only God from an eternity in a fiery hell. He was born a man to ultimately die instead of us. It is the greatest expression of love to die for someone you love.

I want to have that type of love myself, but I am constantly falling short. No matter how hard we try, we can't stop sinning and falling short of the love that God shows to us. That is why we need Him in our lives.

I love you and want you to know that I pray for you everyday. May Jesus' love grow in your lives. I love you and merry Christmas!

Richard & Kristi
