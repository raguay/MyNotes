Acts 4:24-31

1. The Apostle Peter and John
	1. Healed a man that was crippled
	2. The Jews told them never to teach the name of Jesus again
	3. Peter declared: "Is it better to obey men or God?"
	4. They went and told the church what happened
	5. The church prayed together
2. The prayer of the church in Jerusalem
	1. God created and rules over everything
	2. Who prophesied by David that
		1. The rulers of this world would hate God and His son
		2. Jesus was killed as the prophesies foretold
	3. It has happened according to God's council of old
	4. Now, see how they are threatened
	5. God would give them boldness to keep preaching the Word of God
	6. God would show signs and wonders to help others Jews see the truth
		1. Signs and wonders are for Jews to help their belief, not the rest of the world!
			- 1 Corinthians 1:22 "For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
			- 1โครินธ์ 1:22 "ด้วยว่าพวกยิวเรียกร้องหมายสำคัญและพวกกรีกเสาะหาปัญญา"
				1. Signs and wonders are for the Jews only
				2. God never used signs to validate the truth to non-Jews
3. After the prayer,
	1. The place shook with an earthquake
	2. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit
