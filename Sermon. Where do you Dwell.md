Psalms 91:1 "He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty."

สดุดี 91:1 "ผู้ที่อาศัยอยู่ ณ ที่กำบังขององค์ผู้สูงสุดจะอยู่ในร่มเงาของผู้ทรงมหิทธิฤทธิ์"

1. Those that dwell
   1. God will deliver (ปลดปล่อย)
      1. Evil and Problems will not control you
   2. God will protect 
      1. You still have problems, but lighter
      2. God's protection never leads to laziness
   3. You will have no fear
      1. The King of the universe is watching over you
      2. Nothing is greater than He is
   4. You will have power over Satan and sin
      1. Satan can only effect you as you give him opportunity by sinning
      2. If you are close enough to God to dwell in his shadow, you aren't giving Satan any opportunities
   5. God will answer
      1. But, not always according to what we pray
      2. His answers are the best for us
2. But if you do not dwell in God's shadow
   1. No deliverance
   2. No protection
   3. Lots of fear
   4. No power over Satan and sin
   5. God will not answer you, your god will have to!
      1. lots of luck!
      2. Baal worshipers could not get their god to answer them on mount Carmel
         1. Elijah just mocked them
