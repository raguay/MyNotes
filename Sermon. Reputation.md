Philippians 2:6-7

1. Our name is associated with how others see us
    1. "God" - All loving, all powerful, all knowing
    2. But, when Jesus came
        1. No one knew who he was, even though he is God
        2. No one understood that, even though he did many miracles and told them
        3. No one wanted to believe that God could be like them
        4. Jesus had no reputation with the world, but with God
2. What does your name represent to others?
    1. Your name brings to everyones memory what you are like
        1. Not your perception of yourself
        2. It is how others perceive you to be
            1. If you can handle it, ask some people what you are like
            2. If they are blunt, it may hurt because no one thinks the way you do
        3. You think one way about yourself, but others think differently depending on how they know you
    2. Many people work hard to impress others
        1. They want their name associated with
            1. greatness
            2. smartness
            3. richness
        2. It's often a lie
            1. We think better of ourselves that we should
            2. We don't intentionally lie, but not honest with ourselves.
        3. But the question should be, is your reputation pleasing to God?
            1. When others hear your name, do they think Christian?
            2. When other interact with you, do they think Godly?
3. Are you willing to be of no reputation in the world like God?
    1. God doesn't want us to worry about how others perceive us
    2. He wants us to only think about pleasing Him
    3. Because, being friends with the world (pleasing the world) is the enemy of God.
