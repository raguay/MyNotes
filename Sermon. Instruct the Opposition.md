2 Timothy 2:25-26

1. Those that oppose themselves
    1. Christians that do not teach/follow the truth
    2. They oppose what they are: "Christ Like"
        1. Christ's focus was doing the Father's will
        2. Christ never focused on the rules
        3. Christ avoided false teachings and sin
    3. Usually referring to those that say 
        1. do what you want, your still going to heaven
        2. the law gets you closer to God
        3. rules following instead of following God's will
2. They are in a snare of the devil
    1. a trap, entanglement
        1. The word used often refers to drowsiness
        2. They are asleep to God and therefore can't get out of the trap
    2. they can't escape by themselves
    3. often not realizing they are trapped
3. Taken captive by him at his will
    1. Their actions are under the devil's directions
    2. they think they are following God, but they aren't
    3. Whenever the devil want to use them, they have no strength to resist the devil
        1. Because they aren't submitted to God
        2. They are more committed to their error than to God
4. We, Christians, need to instruct them meekly
    1. Because, we might end up like them
        - Galatians 6:1 "Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted."
        - กาลาเทีย 6:1 "พี่น้องทั้งหลาย ถ้าผู้ใดถูกครอบงำอยู่ในความผิดบาป ท่านซึ่งอยู่ฝ่ายพระวิญญาณ จงช่วยผู้นั้นด้วยใจอ่อนสุภาพให้เขากลับตั้งตัวใหม่ โดยคิดถึงตัวเอง เกรงว่าท่านจะถูกชักจูงให้หลงไปด้วย"
            1. Meekness keeps us from the same sin
