2 Timothy 2:25-26 "In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth; And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."

2ทิโมธี 2:25-26 "ด้วยความอ่อนสุภาพจงสอนคนเหล่านั้นที่ต่อสู้กับตัวเอง ถ้าพระเจ้าอาจจะทรงโปรดให้เขากลับใจเสียใหม่มารับความจริง และเขาอาจหลุดพ้นบ่วงของพญามาร ผู้ซึ่งดักจับเขาไว้ให้ทำตามความประสงค์ของมัน"
