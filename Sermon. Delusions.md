Isaiah 66:4 "I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in which I delighted not."

อิสยาห์ 66:4 "เราก็จะเลือกการหลอกหลอนมาให้เขาด้วย และนำสิ่งที่เขากลัวมาถึงเขา เพราะเมื่อเราได้เรียก ไม่มีผู้ใดตอบ เมื่อเราพูด เขาไม่ฟัง แต่เขาได้กระทำชั่วต่อหน้าต่อตาของเรา และเลือกสิ่งที่เราไม่ปีติยินดีด้วย""
