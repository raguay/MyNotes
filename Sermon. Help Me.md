"Help me" is 55 times in the Bible

1. A cry for help
   1. It is a acknowledgement that we are not able to help ourselves
   2. Humbly asking God for help
   3. Admission that God is able to do anything
   4. He acknowledges that God is his strength! Not self.
2. A cry for speed
   1. It isn't wrong to tell God you need it now
   2. But, we still have to humbly accept His timing
3. A cry for closeness to God
   1. We can't expect help while we are far from God
   2. We can't do our own will and expect God to be with us
   3. If God isn't near unto us, He doesn't really help us.
      1. Your on your own
      2. You choose your sin over closeness with God
