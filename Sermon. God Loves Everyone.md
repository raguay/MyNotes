Jonah 1:1-2 "Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me."

โยนาห์ 1:1-2 "พระวจนะของพระเยโฮวาห์มาถึงโยนาห์บุตรชายของอามิททัยว่า "จงลุกขึ้นไปยังนีนะเวห์นครใหญ่ และร้องกล่าวโทษชาวเมืองนั้น เหตุความชั่วของเขาทั้งหลายได้ขึ้นมาเบื้องหน้าเราแล้ว""

1. Ninavah (นีนะเวห์) was a city of evil people
   1. They loved to torture others
   2. They conquered many nations
2. But, God loved them and sent them a message
   1. By Jonah (โยนาห์), who didn't love Ninavah
   2. Jonah rebelled and ran the opposite direction
   3. God sent a storm and then a whale to swallow him
   4. Jonah gave the Ninavites the message from God
      1. A warning of judgment
      2. If they didn't repent, God was going to destroy them.
   5. They repented
   6. But Jonah was mad
      1. He wanted them to pay for all the evil they had done
      2. He didn't want them to get mercy
3. Even though the Ninavites were not worthy of love
   1. God still loved them enough to warn them
   2. They repented and wasn't destroyed
      1. because they repented, God showed them mercy
4. We all are just like the Ninavites
   1. We aren't worthy of God's love
      1. We only deserve God's judgment because we refuse to follow Him.
      2. He gave us life and a great place to live while we simply ignore Him
   2. But, God created a plan to help us
      1. Jesus became a man and took the punishment in our place.
      2. Anyone who believes that Jesus is the only God and has done everything to forgive their sins and trust in Jesus alone can be Christians.
      3. He sent Christians to tell other about His love.
5. Do you love those around you?
   1. God wants to save them and has called you to tell them just like he did Jonah
   2. What does God have to do in your life to get you to tell them?
      1. He had Jonah spend three days/nights in a whales belly.
