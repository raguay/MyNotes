Daniel 1:8 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
ดาเนียล 1:8 แต่ดาเนียลตั้งใจไว้ว่าจะไม่กระทำตัวให้เป็นมลทินด้วยอาหารสูงของกษัตริย์ หรือด้วยเหล้าองุ่นซึ่งพระองค์ดื่ม เพราะฉะนั้นเขาจึงขอหัวหน้าขันทีให้ยอมเขาที่ไม่กระทำตัวให้เป็นมลทิน

1. Daniel and his friends taken captive to Babalon
   1. They were most likely around 15 years old by most commentators
   2. Israel had disobeyed God and God disciplined them
      1. They saw friends and family die in the war
      2. They were on their own
2. The King gave them food and drink
   1. The tradition for captives is giving food sacrificed to their idols
   2. Also, they usually strangled the animals before killing
      1. This goes against Jewish dietary law
   3. For a devoted Jew, that food would be wrong for them to eat
      1. Therefore, would hurt their relationship with God.
      2. They weren't rule followers, but wanted a close relationship with God.
3. Daniel's decision
   1. Not to eat the King's meat and wine
      1. They ate just vegitables and water
      2. None of the delicious foods that the King would give
   2. They wanted to be the best they could be for God
      1. They didn't want a mediocre religion, but true devotion to God
      2. They didn't want to wait until they were old to serve God
         1. They were going to do it now!
      3. Even when their other friends, family, and country didn't, they walked with God.
         1. It was their decision
         2. They stood by it always!
   3. God was able to use them in a mighty way.
4. What is your decision?
   1. You want to be the best you can for God?
   2. Or, be compromised by following the world (popular decisions)?
