Ezekiel 1-48

1. Ezekiel
    1. Priest of the Lord in captivity
    2. God had disciplined Israel by Babylon destroying Israel and taking some captive
        1. Ezekiel was in the first group taken captive
        2. The second capture happened during Ezekiel chapter 21
        3. That was the final exodus of Israel
    3. God showed Ezekiel so many visions of Himself and angels
        1. Many worldly scholars believe it was UFOs that he saw and not God and His angels.
        2. Others feel he was just crazy
        3. But, God was using him to get Israel to understand their sins
    4. Just like Isaiah, Ezekiel's wife dies as a testimony to the coming judgement of Israel
        1. God tells him not to mourn for her
        2. Israel will have family killed in the judgement that they will not be able to cry
2. God used Ezekiel
    1. Prophesy for Judgement of Israel - Chapter 1-21
    2. Prophesy for Judgement of other countries and the Restoration of Israel mixed together - Chapter 21-39
    3. Prophesy of the Millennial Kingdom and Heaven mixed together - Chapter 40 on
    4. History of Satan and final end - Chapter 28
    5. Christian Responsibility
        1. Watchman of God - Ezekiel 3:16-21, 33:1-9
        2. Someone to Stand in the Gap
        3. Mostly about how if one person in Israel would just walk with God always, Israel would be safe!
        4. In our country now, God is doing the same thing!
