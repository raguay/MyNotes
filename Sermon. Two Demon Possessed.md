Luke 8:26-39
Mark 5:1-20
Matthew 8:28-34

1. Both stories are the same
    1. Men possessed by devils met with Jesus
        1. In Luke and Mark, it is a single man that has been possessed a long time
            1. He had so many devils that they collectively called themselves Legion
            2. More details is given about the man and his family
        2. In Matthew, it is two people possessed
            1. No details at all about the people
    2. Jesus casts the devils out to swine
    3. The swine commit suicide to get rid of the devils
    4. But, in Luke and Mark, the single man asks to follow Jesus
        1. In Matthew, the two possessed didn't do anything that Matthew recorded after the devils were cast out.
2. Why the discrepancy (ความคลาดเคลื่อน)?
    1. People like to say that the Bible is wrong due to inconsistencies
        1. If an all knowing God wrote it, it should be perfect in the accounts
        2. They want to find a reason not to trust in Jesus
    2. But, the fact is, it is written from four points of view
        1. Matthew - for the Jews, the Messiah
        2. Mark - the suffering servant
        3. Luke - to all gentiles
        4. John - the Son of God that is God made flesh
    3. Mark & Luke was for all to see the changed life of a lost person
    4. Matthew just wants to show the power of God and the fulfilling of prophecy proclaiming Jesus is the Messiah of the Jews!
    5. Both are correct, just different details
        1. All three accounts are about two men
        2. One wants to follow Jesus after being rescued while the other didn't
        3. Jesus helped both of them, but only one got saved and followed Jesus
        4. Many people receive from God and don't get saved
    6. We have to accept God's way of teaching and just put the details together
        1. There isn't any contradiction in details, just omission of details by some
        2. Omission doesn't mean one is wrong, they just didn't discuss that issue.
