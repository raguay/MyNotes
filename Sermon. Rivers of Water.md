John 7:37-39

1. Everyone that believes
	1. Saving faith in Jesus as God and Lord
	2. Not lip service
	3. but a life truly trusting on Jesus
2. "out of his belly **shall** flow rivers"
	1. This must happen
		1. A saved person without this is still lost!
		2. This is part of the changed life that the Bible is constantly referring to.
	2. Water cleans as it flows
		1. junk is taken away
		2. leaving only that which is "clean"
	3. It flows out
		1. changing that which it touches
			1. Inner self 
			2. outer self
			3. others in our life
3. "living water"
	1. water that makes alive
	2. It's not passive, but active touching us and others
	3. Here, Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit
      1. It calls us to walk with God 
      2. When we respond in submission, the Holy Spirit enables us to be a better witness
4. Do you have it?
	1. Get Saved!
		1. Only the child of God can ask for it
		2. Free gift by faith
  2. Ask! believing He will give it!
    - Luke 11:13 "If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?"
    - ลูกา 11:13 "เพราะฉะนั้น ถ้าท่านทั้งหลายเองผู้เป็นคนชั่ว ยังรู้จักให้ของดีแก่บุตรของตน ยิ่งกว่านั้นสักเท่าใด พระบิดาของท่านผู้ทรงสถิตในสวรรค์ จะทรงประทานพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์แก่ผู้ที่ขอต่อพระองค์""
5. But, Many will not have it
	1. Refusing God to change their lives
      1. We stop God's Spirit touching the lives around us when we don't let God lead our lives
	2. Denying that God has a right to our lives
      1. Jesus has the right to lead us daily.
      2. He is the King!
      3. He paid the price for our salvation
