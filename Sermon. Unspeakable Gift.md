2โครินธ์ 9:15 "จงขอบพระคุณพระเจ้าเพราะของประทานซึ่งพระองค์ทรงประทานนั้นที่เหลือจะพรรณนาได้"

1. Gift
   1. Something undeserving
   2. We do nothing to get it
   3. It is something received from one that loves us
2. Unspeakable
   1. Something so wonderful that we are without words
   2. Something so unexpected that we are struck with amazement
3. Unspeakabe Gift
   1. Something we do not deserve, but is given to us
   2. Something so beyond our imagination that we are in complete awe and wonder
      1. We totally did not deserve it
      2. We had no ideal about we could get it
4. Unspeakable Gift vs a normal Gift
   1. A normal gift
      1. We are thankful when we get it
      2. But, then forget it was given to us
      3. we take it for a common thing, nothing really special
   2. An unspeakable gift
      1. We never get over the gratitude for getting it
      2. We want to do whatever we can for the one that gave it
      3. We are constantly thinking about it and how much we love the giver
5. Is salvation a normal gift for you or an unspeakable gift?
   1. If it's just normal, you do nothing for God
      1. You expect to receive it
      2. You don't see a need to live for God
      3. Most likely, you never got it because you never saw your true need for it
   2. But, if it's an unspeakable gift for you
      1. Then you never get over the fact you were given it
      2. You do anything for God because you love Him
