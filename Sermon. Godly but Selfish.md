2 Kings 20:12-19

2 Kings 20:19 "Then said Hezekiah unto Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD which thou hast spoken. And he said, Is it not good, if peace and truth be in my days?"

2พงศ์กษัตริย์ 20:19 "แล้วเฮเซคียาห์ตรัสกับอิสยาห์ว่า "พระวจนะของพระเยโฮวาห์ซึ่งท่านกล่าวนั้นก็ดีอยู่" เพราะพระองค์ดำริว่า "ก็ดีแล้วมิใช่หรือ ในเมื่อมีความอยู่เย็นเป็นสุขและความจริงในวันเวลาของเรา""

1. Hezekiah (เฮเซคียาห์)
    1. A king over Judia that was Godly
        - 2 Kings 18:3 "And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that David his father did."
        - 2พงศ์กษัตริย์ 18:3 "และพระองค์ทรงกระทำสิ่งที่ถูกต้องในสายพระเนตรของพระเยโฮวาห์ ตามทุกสิ่งที่ดาวิดบรรพบุรุษของพระองค์ได้ทรงกระทำ"
    2. He knew only God could protect them and lead them
    3. Twice the Assyrian army threatened attack and God sent them back
        1. After an angel of God killed 180,000 Assyrian soldiers
        2. An answer to King Hezekiah's prayer
2. But, He was prideful
    1. He became sick unto death
    2. God tells him to set his house in order for he will die
    3. He cries to God to give him more time
        1. He didn't have an heir to the throne
    4. God heals him and promises 15 more years of life
        1. He then had a son, Manasseh, who was the most wicked king in Israel.
        2. But, Manasseh's son ended up being the most righteous, God loving king in Israel.
    5. God gives a sign of the sun moving back 10 degrees
        1. Something that could never happen in nature
        2. Showed God's wondrous power and might
3. The Babylonian ambassadors come
    1. At the same time the sun went back 10 degrees, they hear that king Hezekiah was healed
        1. The Babylonians worship the sun as a god
        2. Their "god" moved out of natural order 
        3. They sent to see if there was a connection
    2. But, Hezekiah just showed them his great wealth
        1. He should of bragged on God, but he didn't
    3. God tells Hezekiah that Babylon will destroy Israel from his grandchildren
4. But, Hezekiah only cared about his life
    1. Verse 19 shows his lack of concern for the future of Israel and his grandchildren
        1. I think that is way Manasseh went so bad.
    2. As long as he has an easy life and property, who cares about the future.
        1. This is the worse type of selfishness.
        2. But, many Christians seem to think this way as well.
5. Are we being like Hezekiah?
    1. Not doing the things to help our children and grandchildren to follow God
        1. Reading the Bible as a family
        2. Praying as a family
        3. Going to and helping in the church as a family
        4. Taking problems to God first as a family
        5. Talking about God and how He has guided the family
        6. Allowing things in the home that God doesn't like
        7. Walking with God daily!
