1 Corinthians 14:1 "Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."

1โครินธ์ 14:1 "จงมุ่งหาความรัก และจงปรารถนาของประทานฝ่ายจิตวิญญาณ เฉพาะอย่างยิ่งการพยากรณ์"

1. We are to desire Spiritual Gifts (ของประทานฝ่ายจิตวิญญาณ)
    1. Special abilities for God's usage
        1. Everything that God asks us to do, He empowers us to do it.
        2. We can only do things for God by His power and abilities that He gives us.
    2. Empowered by the Holy Spirit
        1. Only as we walk after the Spirit.
        2. The gift used our own way is a mess.
    3. We are to use them out of Love
        1. Helping others without receiving anything in return
        2. True love doesn't look to what you get back
        3. It simply helps others.
2. Seek to Prophesy (การพยากรณ์)
    1. Understanding God's Word
        1. Old prophets understood what God wanted them to speak
        2. They knew God's word
            1. They could tell the difference in the devil or self thinking and God speaking.
    2. Teaching others God's Word
        1. Their life was spent telling others what God has told them
        2. None of the prophets kept it to themselves
    3. We are to be seeking to know, understand, and teach other's God's word
3. Are we living up to this verse?
