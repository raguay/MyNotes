Luke 23:39-43

1. Two prisoners killed with Jesus
    1. They had killed and/or stolen, the Bible doesn't really say
		1. In the Roman Empire, non-Romans that stole or killed were crucified
		2. Therefore, it had to be one of those reasons
    2. Either way, one prisoner insulted Him
        1. "if thou be Christ, save thyself and us"
        2. He did not really believe Jesus could do it
        3. He assumed Jesus to be just a man like him
			1. by asking for proof shows no faith
    3. The other prisoner rebukes the first
		1. Showed they deserved what they were getting
		2. But, Jesus had never sinned and therefore not worthy of punishment
	4. Then asked Jesus to remember him in His kingdom
        1. He accepted that Jesus is God and King
        2. He understood that He would come into His kingdom
        3. He trusted Jesus could redeem his sins.
        4. He believed upon the name of Jesus Christ
2. Jesus accepted the repentant sinner
    1. He is in heaven with Jesus by faith alone
        1. He never attended a church service
        2. He never was baptized
        3. He did not understand all the prophecies or memorized Bible verses
        4. Since he was a thief, most likely never paid his tithes
        5. He simply accepted who Jesus is and believe Jesus could save him.
			1. The one and only God that created everything
3. That is the only way anyone will get to heaven
    1. Simply believing that 
        1. Jesus is God
            1. Sole authority on your life.
        2. You are a sinner
            1. You've never done anything good to merit heaven
            2. You only deserve death and hell!
        3. Jesus will accept you and clean you of all sin
    2. Nothing else will help!
		1. Things that can't help
			1. Church attendance
			2. Keeping rules - we have already broken one or more!
			3. Paying money
			4. Prayer or rituals
		2. We can only be saved by faith alone
			- Ephesians 2:8-9 "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."
			- เอเฟซัส 2:8-9 "ด้วยว่าซึ่งท่านทั้งหลายรอดนั้นก็รอดโดยพระคุณเพราะความเชื่อ และมิใช่โดยตัวท่านทั้งหลายเอง แต่พระเจ้าทรงประทานให้ ความรอดนั้นจะเนื่องด้วยการกระทำก็หามิได้เพื่อมิให้คนหนึ่งคนใดอวดได้"
