Psalms 17:1-3 

1. David wanted God to hear his prayers
	1. He understood that there was no help from man
		- Psalms 108:12 'Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.'
		- Psalms 108:12 'ขอประทานความช่วยเหลือเพื่อต่อต้านความยุ่งยากต่างๆ เพราะความช่วยเหลือของมนุษย์ก็ไร้ผล'
	2. He wanted God's help, but he was a sinner
		1. The natural state of his speech was sin
			1. Singing a song just for the fun of singing
			2. Saying things just to be heard
			3. Saying things just to follow the crowd
			4. Saying things that we know others want to hear
			5. Using idle words (คำไม่ได้ใช้งาน)
		2. Therefore, David worked hard to correct his speech
			1. Speaking only what he truly felt
			2. He worked hard at never using idle words or songs
2. So, he purposed to keep is speech acceptable to God
	1. Everything he spoke was his true desires
		1. He never spoke just to be heard
		2. Everything he said was truly his desires
	2. Even to asking God to search his heart
		1. He wanted God to hold him to keeping his speech godly
		2. He truly believed that God would discipline wrong or idle speech
			1. He even accepted the discipline with joy!
3. Is this our desire?
	1. It should be the goal of all Christians
	2. We should never let idle words cross our lips!
