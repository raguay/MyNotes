Matthew 7:15-23

1. False Prophets
   1. Jesus warning that there will be people who teach wrong things
      1. Women pastors/preachers
      2. Not allowing to eat certain foods
      3. Committing suicide to go to heaven
      4. etc.
   2. Jesus is warning His disciples
      1. So that they aren't fooled by them
      2. So that they don't become the false teachers
      3. So that they can teach others as well
   3. Types False Teaches
      1. Intentional
         1. They have the goal of creating a group that follows them
         2. It is characterized as pride
            1. I have the biggest church
            2. I have the best bus minitry
            3. etc.
         3. Whenever it becomes about self, it's no longer about God
      2. Unintentional
         - Jude 1:4 "For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
         - ยูดา 1:4 "เพราะว่ามีบางคนได้เล็ดลอดเข้ามาอย่างไม่รู้ตัว ซึ่งเป็นผู้ที่ถูกเล็งไว้ล่วงหน้ามานานแล้วว่าจะได้รับการพิพากษาลงโทษอย่างนี้ เป็นคนอธรรม ที่ได้บิดเบือนพระคุณของพระเจ้าของเราไปเป็นการกระทำความชั่วช้าลามก และได้ปฏิเสธพระเจ้าคือองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าแต่เพียงพระองค์เดียว และพระเยซูคริสต์องค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าของเรา"
           1. Because of personal laziness, misunderstanding, or listening to the devil because of personal sin
           2. Unconfessed sin causes us to believe lies of the devil easily
2. Fruit
   1. Is the results of what they do
      1. For example: the false teaching that women can teach men Bible doctrine in the church leads to female pastors. That is the fruit of that wrong teaching.
   2. You can tell false teaching by the effects their teaching it has
      1. Less witnessing, bible reading, etc
      2. Breaking some law in the Bible or of country
      3. Anything that is against God's nature and Word
3. Master
   1. All false teaching come down to the question of 'who is in control'
      1. They want their preferences which becomes a teaching
   2. Most false teaching start in people not willing to follow what God has given in His Word.
      1. Women wanting to teach men while God doesn't
      2. Feeling a book written that long ago can't hold for now a days.
      3. They say "Lord, Lord" but never plan to follow what He says. - v. 21
   3. Others, by wanting to follow a man and not God
      1. They like someone's teaching and follow them instead of God
      2. That can cause the person to become prideful and fail
      3. Causes the person following to teach what they heard from him, not from God's word
         1. Repeating someone's speech often gets a garbled message
         2. Just like gossip starts innocently, but ends up very bad
4. The only guard against false teaching is
   1. To surrender your life to God
   2. Follow what is in His Word
      1. Not just part, but all of God's Word
