        2. Unintentional
            - Jude 1:4 "For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ."
            - ยูดา 1:4 "เพราะว่ามีบางคนได้เล็ดลอดเข้ามาอย่างไม่รู้ตัว ซึ่งเป็นผู้ที่ถูกเล็งไว้ล่วงหน้ามานานแล้วว่าจะได้รับการพิพากษาลงโทษอย่างนี้ เป็นคนอธรรม ที่ได้บิดเบือนพระคุณของพระเจ้าของเราไปเป็นการกระทำความชั่วช้าลามก และได้ปฏิเสธพระเจ้าคือองค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าแต่เพียงพระองค์เดียว และพระเยซูคริสต์องค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าของเรา"
                1. Because of personal laziness, misunderstanding, or listening to the devil because of personal sin
                2. Unconfessed sin causes us to believe lies of the devil easily

        3. anything that is against God's nature and Word
3. Master
    1. All false teaching come down to the question of 'who is in control'
        1. They want their preferences which becomes a teaching
    2. Most false teaching start in people not willing to follow what God has given in His Word.
        1. Women wanting to teach men while God doesn't
        2. Feeling a book written that long ago can't hold for now a days.
        3. They say "Lord, Lord" but never plan to follow what He says.
    3. Others, by wanting to follow a man and not God
        1. They like someone's teaching and follow them instead of God
        2. That can cause the person to become prideful and fail
        3. Causes the person following to teach what they heard from him, not from God's word
            1. Repeating someone's speech often gets a garbled message
            2. Just like gossip starts innocently, but ends up very bad
