2 Peter 2:1-6
Jude 1:6-8 - Very similar with the same idea

1. False teachers - People pretending to be what they aren't
    1. Teach salvation without accepting God as Lord
        1. He created us and left us to our own desires
        2. He's not interested in our daily lives
    2. Do whatever you want, God forgives
        1. A truly saved person would not want to live outside of God's will
        2. They are showing their worthiness to be judged
        3. All false teaching are rooted in a desire to be our own bosses and not follow after God by love
    3. They cause others to speak evil of Christianity
        1. The lost know what a Godly person is more than false Christians do
2. God's Judgment 
    1. God spared not the angels that sinned
        1. here, God says some are in chains of darkness until now
        2. God reserves them for the time of Judgement 
        3. Angels had a high position
            1. In heaven with God
            2. Close to God
        4. But, they still sinned
            1. Our closeness to God doesn't make us unable to sin
            2. We need to ever be aware of sin's entangling power to get us!
    2. God brought judgment on the world by
        1. Noah's day a flood
        2. Lot's day fire from heaven
    3. God judged them to be an example
        1. Not to live with out God
3. Therefore, those that want to claim God, but deny Him
    1. Understand that God will judge you
    2. Often in your family
