2 Peter 2:1-6 "But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction. And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment; And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly; And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly;"

1. False teachers
   1. Teach salvation without accepting God as Lord
   2. Do whatever you want, God forgives
      1. A truly saved person would not want to live outside of God's will
      2. They are showing their worthiness to be judged
      3. All false teaching are rooted in a desire to be our own bosses and not follow after God by love
   3. They cause others to speak evil of Christianity
2. God's Judgment 
   1. God spared not the angels that sinned
      1. here, God says some are in chains of darkness until now
      2. God reserves them for the time of Judgement 
      3. Angels had a high position
         - In heaven with God
         - Close to God
      4. But, they still sinned
         - Our closeness to God doesn't make us unable to sin
         - We need to ever be aware of sin's entangling power to get us!
   2. God brought judgment on the world by
      1. Noah's day a flood
      2. Lot's day fire from heaven
   3. God judged the to be an example
      1. Not to live with out God
3. Therefore, those that want to claim God, but deny Him
   1. Understand that God will judge you
   2. Often in your family
