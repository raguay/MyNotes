Genesis 4:1-15

1. All of Adam and Eve's children were born after their sin
    1. Therefore, everyone had inherited sin and a sin nature
    2. There are none righteous
        - Romans 3:10 "As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:"
        - โรม 3:10 "ตามที่มีเขียนไว้แล้วว่า `ไม่มีผู้ใดเป็นคนชอบธรรมสักคนเดียว ไม่มีเลย"
    3. We have no idea how many children Adam and Eve had
        1. We know by name Cain, Abel, and Seth
        2. Their spouses had to come from Adam and Eve
            1. Back then, it wasn't a sin to marry a brother or sister
            2. It wasn't bad for genetics then either
        3. The Bible just says they have many
    4. Adam and Eve taught their children the right thing to offer God
        1. Not our works
            1. Not the things we do
        2. But, a blood sacrifice to atone for our sins
            1. Looking to Jesus: God's sacrificial lamb
2. Cain was a farmer
3. Able was a shepherd
4. They both offered to God
    1. Cain offered the fruit of his works
        1. His works are good enough for God
        2. He did not believe he was a sinner
    2. Abel offered a sacrificial lamb
        1. acknowledging his sinfulness and need for God
