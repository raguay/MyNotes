1 Thessalonians 3:9-13

1. Paul's Prayer for the Thessalonians
	1. Thanks to God for the Thessalonians - v. 9
		1. The apostles have joy in the Thessalonians because of their faith
		2. Thankful to God for working in their hearts
			1. No one seeks God on their own
				- Romans 3:11 "There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God."
				- โรม 3:11 "ไม่มีคนที่เข้าใจ ไม่มีคนที่แสวงหาพระเจ้า"
			2. Therefore, it is God's gift to us that people respond to the Gospel
	2. Praying to see them again - v. 10
		1. Night and day
			1. As Paul prayed continuously (1 Thess. 5:17)
			2. He never stopped praying for them and other Christians
			3. He was a great prayer warrior
				1. Which we are greatly lacking in this day and age
			4. Since it is in the Word of God
				1. It wasn't flattery, flowery speech, but his true work in prayer
		2. In order to help perfect their faith
			1. We all have parts lacking in our faith and walk with God
			2. We need to work on it
			3. We need prayer to keep working on it
	3. Praying for God to direct Paul to Thessalonia - v. 11
		1. It is okay to tell God what we would like to do
		2. Just be willing to do what God wants us to do
	4. God will make us increase - v. 12
		1. in love with fellow church members
		2. in love with the lost world so we will win them
		3. The apostle's love for them as an example
	5. The end result of that kind of love - v. 13
		1. Our hearts are established in God
			1. Not in the things of this world
		2. Faultless in holiness 
			1. By walking with God daily
		3. Waiting for Christ's return
2. We need this type of prayer always
