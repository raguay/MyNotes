Hebrews 9:27 "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment:"

ฮีบรู 9:27 "มีข้อกำหนดสำหรับมนุษย์ไว้แล้วว่าจะต้องตายหนหนึ่ง และหลังจากนั้นก็จะมีการพิพากษาฉันใด"

1. This verse is used much with funerals
    1. At a funeral, we see that a life has ended
    2. The verse helps those to understand that there will not be another life for this person.
        1. Which also means those listening only have this life before judgment
    3. No one want to think about the judgment to come
        1. Not sure if they measure up to the judge!
2. But, this verse is for Christians as well
    1. We only have one life to live for Christ 
    2. We then will face a different judgment 
       - 2 Corinthians 5:10: 'For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.'
       - 2 โคริน 5:10 'เพราะว่าจำเป็นที่เราทุกคนจะต้องปรากฏตัวที่หน้าบัลลังก์พิพากษาของพระคริสต์ เพื่อทุกคนจะได้รับสมกับการที่ได้ประพฤติในร่างกายนี้ แล้วแต่จะดีหรือชั่ว'
            1. Sins aren't judged
               1. Our sins have been paid for by Christ's blood
               2. They will never be judged again.
            2. It is our works that Christ is going to judge - 1 Corinthians 2:12-15
               1. The things we do are directed by whom?
               2. If they are gold, silver, and jewels, they pass the fire test and were works Jesus directed us to do 
               3. Otherwise, they are wood, hay, and stubble and burn up in the fire test.
                  1. They were works of self will
3. We only have one life to live here for Christ
    1. Will your works now survive the fire test?
    2. Or, will everything you do get burned up?
