			2. Saul refused to let David be king
			3. Saul tried to kill David
			4. Saul also used a witch to call up Samuel
	2. But, the Lords of the Philistines refused him to help

		2. He pretended to be offended and left for Ziglag - his home in exile
2. Ziglag was destroyed

	2. All the belongings stolen
	3. The houses burned
	4. Nothing was left when David and his men got there
3. David's men plotted to kill David
	1. It was his fault the city was destroyed
    	1. He brought them out of Israel and settled in a city of the Philistines
	2. They knew they would not be fighting Israel
		1. So, why leave their houses unprotected?
4. David prays 
	1. First, encouraging his heart in God
		1. Singing a spiritual song
		2. Thinking about all that God has done for him
		3. Remembering God's promises
    		1. God promised to always be with him
        		1. It's Gods promise to all that follow Him
    		2. He would be king in Israel
	2. Then he asked God for direction

		2. God said yes and that he would recover all
5. So, encouraged in the Lord and His promises, David and most of his men chases after the foe
	1. They did recover all
    	1. Only their houses were lost
    	2. But, they were moving to Hebron in Israel in a few days

            	1. Israel was defeated by the Philistines
            	2. Saul and his sons were killed in the battle
	2. Because David encouraged himself in the Lord and prayed!
