John 9:4-5 "I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."

1. Jesus is the Light of the world
   John 1:9: 'That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.'
   1. While Jesus is in the world, the world has light
   2. light is
      1. Understanding of the truth
         Psalms 119:130: 'The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.'
      2. People able to walk after God's leadership
         1 John 1:7: 'But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin.'
      3. God is light
         1 John 1:5 "This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all."
      4. Therefore, light can also mean anything that is Godly
      5. Christians are light of the World
         Matthew 5:14 "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."
         John 8:12 "Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life."
2. Night is coming
   1. An absence of Jesus and God in the world
   2. An absence of Christians in the world
   3. That refers to the Tribulation period
3. But what about our local area?
   1. Is it dark there because we aren't the proper light?
   2. Do others see Jesus' light in our lives?
   3. What can we do more?
