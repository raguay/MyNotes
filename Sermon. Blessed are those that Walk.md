Psalms 119:1-11

1. We have to decide everyday 
	1. How will we respond to people around us?
		1. If we just respond based on feelings, we will have a hard life.
	2. What will we base our decision on?
		1. The world would have us make decisions based on what feels good.
		2. This leads to many problems and difficulties.
	3. How will we conduct our lives?
		1. The world would have us to conduct our lives based on society and what everyone else is doing.
		2. As we look around us, we see this type of conduct is empty and has many problems.
2. In order to have the best life possible in this world, we need to make decisions based on what God wants.
	1. These verses say that we are blessed when we walk with God.
		1. It is echoed in the new testament as well
			- Galatians 5:16 "This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh."
			- กาลาเทีย 5:16 "แต่ข้าพเจ้าขอบอกว่า จงดำเนินชีวิตตามพระวิญญาณและท่านจะไม่สนองความต้องการของเนื้อหนัง"
	2. It's not a suggestion, but a command. V. 4
		1. Many Christians think it's optional and not expected to really do it.
			1. It's too hard.
			2. I just want an easy life without any thought put into it.
			3. I just want to go with the flow.
		2. But, God here is commanding us to walk with Him.
			1. It is a deliberate action on our part.
			2. It's not just something we experiment with, but something we must do with our whole heart. V. 2
	3. The main point is, hiding God's word in our hearts. V. 11
		1. It's a sin not to walk with God since God has commanded us to do so.
		2. God's Word tells us when we aren't walking with Him.
			1. When you are walking with your friend in a large crowd of people, you have to look after them continually.
			2. The same way, this world has many voices trying to influence us.
			3. Only when we compare our lives with God’s Word do we know if we are walking with Him.
		3. Without God's Word in our hearts, we never know who we are following.
			1. Our own wicked heart wants to be in control.
			2. Satan wants to control us.
			3. The world wants to be in control.
		4. We will get confused when we don't have God's Word in our hearts.
3. Therefore, what kind of life do you want?
	1. Like everyone else
		1. Read the news, it's a mess out there!
	2. Like what God has for you
		1. Then you will be blessed.
