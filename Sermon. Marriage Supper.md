Matthew 22:2-14

1. A rich ruler had a wedding feast for his one and only son
	1. He invited the people that should of came
		1. Relatives
		2. Close Friends
		3. Those of his kingdom
	2. They made light of it
		1. Abusing the king's servants
		2. Killing the king's servants
	3. King sent in the solders
		1. Killing everyone that would not come and killed the king's servants
	4. The king had his servants go and get everyone they could find to come instead
		1. They went everywhere inviting people to the wedding
	5. When he went to meat the guests
		1.  One didn't have the wedding garment
			1.  In Jewish tradition, the host of the wedding is to supply a garment for everyone to wear
			2.  Therefore, everyone looks the same
		2.  Since the father provided them for everyone, he simply didn't want what was provided for him
		3.  The man was cast out to "utter darkness with gnashing of teeth"
2.  Picture of right now
	1.  The king and his son
		1.  God the Father and Son
	2.  Servants
		1.  Christians with the Holy Spirit leading them
	3.  Those that were first called
		1.  The Jewish nation
		2.  Mostly rejected the offer from God
		3.  God killed most of the people in Jerusalem by Romans in AD 70
	4.  Those that were compelled to join in
		1.  People from all over the world
		2.  This part is still happening
	5.  The person without a wedding garment
		1.  The wedding garment
			1.  Christ's righteousness by trusting in Jesus alone as God and savior
			2.  You receive it by faith in the finished work of Christ
			3.  You keep it by the sealing power of the Holy Spirit
		2.  A false Christian
			1.  He trusted in Church membership, ceremonies, etc.
		3.  Wanting to go to heaven his own way and not accept the righteousness of God
			1.  He refused to serve God, but served self instead
			2.  It is literally spitting in the face of the Father and stepping on the Blood of Christ
		4.  He went to Hell
