Luke 2:19 "But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart."

ลูกา 2:19 "ฝ่ายนางมารีย์ก็เก็บบรรดาสิ่งเหล่านี้ไว้ในใจ และรำพึงอยู่"

1. Mary loves her child
		1. She kept in her heart
			1. Everything the Angel told her
				1. Everything he did
				2. Everything he said
				3. Everything about his life
			2. She would return and think about it more
				1. When he grows up and preaches all around
				2. While they are beating him and putting him on the cross
				3. When he rose from the dead, then she really understood all he said
2. Every good mother will always view their child
        1. Still a child
                1. A mother will still think of the little one at home
                2. Even when they are grown and have their own kids
        2. She will keep everything in her heart
            1. She thinks on those special events always
                1. The moment she knew she was with child
                2. The birth, but the pain does block some of the memories
                3. The first tooth, walk, fall
            2. She might forget the fine details (day, hour, etc.)
                1. But, the main points she ponders in her heart
        3. She will think about those things when
            1. the child isn't home
            2. the child is sick and she is worried
            3. the child is grown and gone
