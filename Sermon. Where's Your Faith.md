Luke 8:22-25

1. There was a great storm
   1. Disciples were afraid
   2. They felt they would die
   3. They called out to Jesus to save them
   4. Jesus calmed the sea and the storm
2. Jesus asked them a simple question
      1. Where is their faith
            1. In their abilities
                  1. Most of the disciples were experienced fishermen
                  2. They knew how to handle a bad storm
            2. In what they could see
                  1. The storm was the worse they ever saw
                  2. Poor Matthew was scared because he used to be a tax collector
                        1. He never experienced such a problem
            3. In their experiences
                  1. They had handled many storms on the sea
      2. But with our faith in what we know and can do
            1. We will experience fear!
      3. If our faith is in Jesus, storms of life would not scare us
            1. Always sure in Jesus' control
            2. What He allows in our lives is good for us
3. We need to examine ourselves about our faith
	1. In self or in Jesus for everything in life!
