1 Kings 21:4: 'And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him down upon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.'

1. Naboth
	1. Owned land next to King Ahab's palace
		1. It was land passed down from the time Israel came to the land with Joshua.
		2. God strictly prohibited the moving of land from one tribe to another
			- Numbers 36:7 "So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers."
			- กันดารวิถี 36:7 "ดังนี้แหละส่วนมรดกของคนอิสราเอลจะไม่ถูกโยกย้ายจากตระกูลหนึ่งไปให้อีกตระกูลหนึ่ง คนอิสราเอลทุกคนต้องอยู่ในที่มรดกแห่งตระกูลบรรพบุรุษของตน" 
	1. Ahab wanted it for a garden to enjoy
		1. It wasn't a need, but a want - ie: not important
	2. But, Naboth refused to sell it
		1. It is his families inheritance from the Lord
2. King Ahab
	1. Threw a fit and refused to eat
	2. His wife, who doesn't believe in God, fixed it for him
		1. She had Naboth killed
			1. By lies and trickery
			2. Two men lied about Naboth cursing God and the king.
		2. Once dead, Ahab didn't ask any questions
			1. He just took the land for his own
	3. God promised to kill Ahab and all of his children for this act!
		1. He was very sorrowful for the judgment
		2. But, he still kept the land
3. Whining might get you what you want
	1. But, it will not be God's will
	2. It will cause much pain in the future
		1. Even to your children and grandchildren!
