1. Gideon
	1. While threshing wheat in a hidden area
		1. An angel of God calls him brave and will lead Israel to triumph over their enemies
		2. Gideon asks for two miracles to confirm the call

			2. The fleece only has dew and the ground dry
	2. Gideon calls the army
		1. 32,000 soldiers to begin with

			1. Send back all that are fearful
				1. 10,000 go home
			2. Have them drink water from a stream
				1. 300 drank by cupping their hands and drinking from their hand
				2. 21,700 drank by putting their mouth in the water
				3. God told him to use the 300! 21,700 more went home.
	3. Gideon listens to the enemy
		1. Since Gideon was still afraid, God sent him to listen to the enemy camp
		2. One solder told a dream and it was interpreted that Gideon would destroy them by God's appointment.
	4. God has Gideon and the 300 men
		1. Surround the enemy with a lantern, clay pot, and a bugle
			1. The light was in the pot so it wouldn't be seen
			2. There was a lot of area between each person
		2. At the signal, everyone is to break the pot, sound with bugle, and shout "the sword of the Lord and Gideon"
	5. The enemies started killing each other and gave a great victory to Gideon!
