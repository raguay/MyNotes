      2. Each one is important for the life of the body
   2. All the parts need each other

         1. That particular function doesn't happen
         2. Causing other parts of the body to have problems as well
      2. One hurts, the whole body hurts
         1. Pain in one place makes the whole body hurt
      3. One is honored, the whole body is honored
         1. You can't honor the eye without honoring the whole body
      4. Different functions doesn't make them less useful or not a part
