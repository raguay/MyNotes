# Father of Rain

Job 38:28 "Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?"

โยบ 38:28 "ฝนมีพ่อหรือ หรือผู้ใดได้กระทำให้เกิดหยาดน้ำค้าง"

1. A father is one that starts
	1. Father of a subject is the one that starts that subject in study - Newton is the father of Physics
2. But, people felt that rain just falls
	1. There is nothing that starts it that is not it
