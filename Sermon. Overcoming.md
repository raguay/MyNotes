1 Thessalonians 5:24 'Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.'

1. Trials come to Christians
    1. Job had them
    2. Christ had them
    3. God says Christians will have them
        - John 15:20 'Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.'
        - 2 Timothy 3:12 'Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.'
        - 1 Peter 4:12 "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:"
            1. We will have many difficulties in life
                1. We are soldiers behind enemy lines!
            2. We just have to keep the hurts from hurting us
                1. Overcoming is not letting the hurts of this life interfere with our service to God.
2. We overcome by
    1. Believing in Jesus Christ
        - 1 John 5:4-5 'For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?'
            1. Being saved gives us the ability to overcome
            2. We must examine our faith
                - 2 Corinthians 13:5 'Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?'
    2. Surrendering our lives to His will
        - Galatians 2:20 'I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.'
    3. Willing to suffer in God's will
        - 2 Timothy 1:12 'For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.'
        - Philippians 3:8 'Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,'
        - Philippians 3:10 'That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death;'
    4. Remembering His promises
        -  2 Peter 1:3-4 "According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue: Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust."
            1. We have all we need in His word
                - Isaiah 26:3 'Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.'
                - 1 John 4:4 'Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.'
                - 1 Thessalonians 5:24 'Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.'
                - Romans 8:38-39 "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.'
                    1. And many more!
            2. We just have to hold on to it
3. When we overcome, God promises
    1. Not hurt by the second death
        - Revelation 2:11 'He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.'
    2. Power over the groups of people
        - Revelation 2:26 'And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:'
            1. The greek word for 'nation' is same for any organized group of people.
    3. Confessed before God and the angels
        - Revelation 3:5 'He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.'
    4. Inherit all things, He's our God, we are God's son
        - Revelation 21:7 'He that overwcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.'
