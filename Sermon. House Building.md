Psalms 127:1 "Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain."
สดุดี 127:1 "ถ้าพระเยโฮวาห์มิได้ทรงสร้างบ้าน บรรดาผู้ที่สร้างก็เหนื่อยเปล่า ถ้าพระเยโฮวาห์มิได้ทรงเฝ้าอยู่เหนือนคร คนยามตื่นอยู่ก็เหนื่อยเปล่า"

1. Everyone wants their own house
	1. To keep their things in
	2. To have time away from others not close to us
	3. Something that we can make our own
2. But, when we do it our way
	1. It often goes to ruin
	2. Since we are often lazy, we don't maintain it well or think that we can do it later.
3. If we are doing it for someone else
	1. We would think about how they would want it
	2. If we really love the person we are building it for
		1. We would want to keep it maintained well for that person
		2. It would then be an expression of our love for that person
4. Therefore, if we are building our house for the Lord
	1. We would want it to last as long as the Lord
	2. A place fit for the King of the universe and the one who suffered all to save us!
	3. Since we know the Lord builds thing well
		1. We would ask him how to do it
		2. We would look to Him for direction
		3. We would maintain it well to please Him
5. Therefore, we should build it the Lord's way
	- Proverbs 24:3-4 "Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches."
	- สุภาษิต 24:3-4 "เรือนนั้นเขาสร้างกันด้วยปัญญา และสถาปนามันไว้ด้วยความเข้าใจ โดยความรู้บรรดาห้องก็เต็มไปด้วยความมั่งคั่งล้วนประเสริฐและเพลิดเพลินทั้งสิ้น"
		1. Build it with God's Wisdom
		2. Practice God's Wisdom to establish (maintain it)
		3. Fill it with knowledge from God
6. Any other way leads to the house not lasting as long as it could
	1. We labor hard, but have little that lasts
