1 Corinthians 10:13 "There hath no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it."

1โครินธ์ 10:13 "ไม่มีการทดลองใดๆเกิดขึ้นกับท่าน นอกเหนือจากการทดลองซึ่งเคยเกิดกับมนุษย์ทั้งหลาย แต่พระเจ้าทรงสัตย์ซื่อ พระองค์จะไม่ทรงให้ท่านต้องถูกทดลองเกินกว่าที่ท่านจะทนได้ แต่เมื่อท่านถูกทดลองนั้น พระองค์จะทรงโปรดให้ท่านมีทางที่จะหลีกเลี่ยงได้ด้วย เพื่อท่านจะมีกำลังทนได้"
