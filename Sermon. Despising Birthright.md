Genesis 25:27-34

1. Isaac had two sons
    1. They are twins fighting from the womb
        1. Esau (เอซาว)
            1. A hunter and good cook of meats
            2. He loved being in the forest hunting animals
            3. His dad loved him the most
            4. He was born first
        2. Jacob (ยาโคบ)
            1. A farmer and a good cook of vegetables
            2. He liked staying around the house and working in the field
            3. His mother loved him the most
            4. He was second born, but held to Esau's ankles
2. Esau was hungry
    1. Been hunting for quite a while and found nothing
    2. Saw Jacob's food and wanted some
    3. Jacob sold the food for Esau's Birthright
        1. The savior of the world coming through his children
        2. Esau saw the birthright as nothing of value
            1. A child of God. He wanted his way not God's way.
            2. He did not care for it.
            3. He just wanted His father's blessing alone.
        3. Jacob knew the value of God's blessing and wanted it
    4. Esau valued life and fun in this world more than God's blessings
        1. God would use his family to bless others
        2. He just wanted blessing for self
        3. So, he sold his birthright that he saw as worthless
3. Esau despised (ดูหมิ่น) his birthright (สิทธิบุตรหัวปี)
    1. He saw no value in it for right now
        1. It wasn't something he wanted or cared about
    2. He just wanted comfort and blessings now, not later
        1. If it doesn't help life right now, he didn't care for it
4. Christians often are the same way
    1. Being faithful to church isn't important since it gets in the way of making money or friends
    2. Walking with God can lead to difficulties, so they don't want it
        1. willing to chance God's disfavor for fun
    3. Willing to throw away your birthright as a child of God for pleasures and easiness in this world that is going to Hell.
        1. Not close to God because 
            1. loving self will over following God
            2. The praise of men more than God
            3. Not willing to spend time creating a relationship with God
    4. And therefore, not having God's power in their lives
        - 2 Timothy 3:5 'Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.'
        - 2ทิโมธี 3:5 "เขามีสภาพทางของพระเจ้าภายนอก แต่ฤทธิ์ของทางนั้นเขาปฏิเสธเสีย คนอย่างนี้ท่านจงผินหน้าหนีจากเขาเสียด้วย"
            1. When we neglect or look down on our birthright, we deny the power of God
            2. We aren't willing to be like God
        - James 4:4 'Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.'
        - ยากอบ 4:4 "ท่านทั้งหลายผู้ล่วงประเวณีชายหญิงเอ๋ย ท่านไม่รู้หรือว่า การเป็นมิตรกับโลกนั้นคือการเป็นศัตรูกับพระเจ้า เหตุฉะนั้นผู้ใดใคร่เป็นมิตรกับโลก ผู้นั้นก็เป็นศัตรูของพระเจ้า"
            1. Seeking the world's approval makes you enemies with God
            2. Therefore, no power - you've despised your birthright
