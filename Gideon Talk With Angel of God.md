Judges 6:12-23

1. Gideon threshing barley
	1. Not in the open due to fearing the Midianites
		1. The Midianites every year would come during harvest and destroy and steal the harvest
		2. Israel was in great difficulties due to the Midianites - not enough food
2. Angel of God appears
	1. Sometimes a reference to Jesus before being born of Mary
	2. Sometimes simply means an angel appeared in God's stead
		1. A representative of God that is angelic
3. The Angel calls Gideon brave
	1. While he is doing a cowardly thing, threshing barley in secret
4. Gideon asks why God isn't helping Israel
	1. Israel is in a hard time and many people are starving
	2. God allowed it because of sin and Gideon should already know this
5. God tells Gideon to save Israel
	1. God completely ignores Gideon's question because Gideon should already know
6. Gideon asks for a sign
	1. Gideon prepared an offering to God
	2. A false prophet would not want to offer to God correctly
	3. The angel ascends to heaven in the smoke
7.  Gideon realizes he has seen God and feared he would die
	1.  But God reassures him that he will not day
	2.  Since God doesn't rebuke him for attributing the angel to be God
		1.   It must have been Jesus before being born of Mary
		2.   Only Jesus, God the Father, God the Holy Spirit preexisted before birth
		3.   This is how we know it is Jesus before his birth
8.   We can see that
	1.   It's fine to ask God for a sign about a work that we feel too hard for us
		1.   God understands our faith is sometimes weak
		2.   But, we really shouldn't do it all the time
	2.   God doesn't give signs for things we should be doing normally
		1.   Christian homework
		2.   Our duties to family and work
