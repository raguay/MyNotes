Matthew 13:24-30

1. A land owner
    1. sows good seed
    2. An enemy came during the night
        1. Sowed tares (ข้าวละมาน)
    3. Servants asks
        1. Should we remove the weeds
    4. Owner says no
        1. It might pull up the good wheat
2. This is a parable about the church
    1. God sows good seed (The Word of God)
        1. It produces wheat (christians)
        2. the Wheat will through out more seeds
            1. It is just it's nature
        3. That which grows from the Word is Good
    2. The Enemy is Satan
        1. He sows tares (ข้าวละมาน)
            1. They were not grown from seeds
            2. They don't have or understand God's Word
        2. The tares often look like the wheat when little
            1. They will do what is expected in Church
            2. But, nothing outside of Church for God
        3. These are fake Christians
            1. Never living for God
            2. Looking out for self above everything else
3. These fake Christians are in the church along with real Christians
    1. Removing them harshly will remove the true Christians
        1. Yelling at them
        2. Putting them down before the Church
    2. God says don't do it
        1. Just preach the Word and let them be
        2. God takes care of them in the end
        3. Some will be saved and become wheat
