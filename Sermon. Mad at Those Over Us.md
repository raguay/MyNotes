Genesis 28:6-9

1. Esau was mad at his Jacob and Isaac
    1. Jacob for stealing the blessing Esau sold to him for food
    2. Isaac for blessing Jacob
        1. Even though it was in ignorance
        2. Jacob tried him because Esau was reneging
2. Isaac sent Jacob to get a wife from his family
    1. God did not want them to intermingle with the people of the land
    2. The generations to follow would be very evil people
    3. Jacob obeyed to get away from his brother
3. Esau saw that the women of the land did not please his parents
    1. So he got more wives of the women of the land
    2. He married into Ishmael's family line
    3. He did it to go against his parent's wished because he was mad
4. Decisions made while angry are always wrong
    1. We have the tendency to make decisions to get back at who we are angry with
    2. We are not to get back at all
        - Romans 12:19 "Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord."
        - โรม 12:19 "ท่านผู้เป็นที่รักของข้าพเจ้า อย่าทำการแก้แค้น แต่จงมอบการนั้นไว้แล้วแต่พระเจ้าจะทรงลงพระอาชญา เพราะมีคำเขียนไว้แล้วว่า `องค์พระผู้เป็นเจ้าตรัสว่า "การแก้แค้นเป็นของเรา เราเองจะตอบสนอง""
            1. We are to let God take vengeance for us
            2. Just leave it with God
    3. But since we are trying to get back, it will be a bad decision
        1. Esau's family is at war with Jacob's family until today
        2. If Esau had not made these decision in anger, things might be a lot different!
