Luke 12:16-21

1. One year or more years in a row, A man's crops came in more plentiful than ever
    1. He had no where to place his harvest
        1. His barns were too full
2. He decided to 
    1. Tear down the old barns
    2. Build new barns much larger than before
    3. Live off of this bounty in a life of no work
3. God knew what the rich man didn't
    1. He would die and not enjoy his harvest
        1. Contrary to what some think, God didn't just kill him
        2. It was his time to die due to past decisions
            1. Not eating as God would direct
            2. Not exercising well, he wanted to just 'rest'
            3. No one really knows, but these things can be implied
        3. What we do know is that he wasn't used to getting directions from God
            1. None of his ideas mention God at all
            2. He didn't even give God credit for giving a bountiful harvest
    2. God calls him a fool for not preparing for his death
        1. He had no relationship with God
        2. All that wealth was now going to others
        3. It did him no good
4. By this discourse we know
    1. He wasn't one to ask God for directions
        1. He never gave a thought to asking God what to do
        2. He saw it as his money and he was going to use it as he felt was good
    2. His choices in life led to his death
        1. Maybe if he had followed God, it might of been avoided
    3. His own decisions made him poor with God
        1. Possibly lost and ended in Hell
        2. Possibly saved, but no reward in heaven
            - 1 Corinthians 3:15 "If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
            - 1โครินธ์ 3:15 "ถ้าการงานของผู้ใดถูกเผาไหม้ไป ผู้นั้นก็จะขาดค่าตอบแทนแต่ตัวเขาเองจะรอด แต่เหมือนดังรอดจากไฟ"
