Matthew 24:12 "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."

มัทธิว 24:12 "ความรักของคนเป็นอันมากจะเยือกเย็นลง เพราะความชั่วช้าจะแผ่ขยายออกไป"

1. Christ is talking about the last days before His return
   1. Verses 4-12 tells of things that will happen before Christ removes the church.
      1. False Christs
         1. over 40 people have declared to be Christ since 1800 (2343 BE)
      2. Wars and rumors of wars
         1. for the past 3,400 years
            1. peace for only 268 years
      3. Every nation will hate Christians, great persecutions
      4. famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
      5. Love of many (Christians) will wax cold
   2. Verses 13-28: What happens when the church is removed
      1. Gospel will be preached everywhere
      2. Anti-Christ will rule (abomination of desolation)
   3. Verses 29-31: What happens when Christ returns to Jerusalem
      1. Seeing the moon and stars failing
      2. The sign to the Son of Man in the sky
      3. The angels will gather those that are saved from all the earth (they haven't died yet)
2. But, the main characteristic of Christians when Christ returns: Cold Love
   1. It's not that they don't love at all
      1. They love and show love to their family, friends, relatives
      2. They even show true love to their country some
      3. They love that which is close to them
         1. But those they don't really know, they just don't care about.
         2. They are more intested in what makes them happy in this life.
   2. They don't truly love their neighbor
      1. The Samaritan
         1. Saw a need
         2. Knew he could help
         3. Helped the injured as much as he could
      2. This generation of Christians
         1. Don't see the need of everyone around them
            1. Everyone's going to heaven
            2. They have their own way
         2. They aren't willing to help
            1. When they know someone is not saved, they assume someone else will help them
            2. I don't have the time the pastor, missionary, etc. has to witness
            3. It's not my responsibility
         3. They define 'neighbor' as those around them
            1. family, friends, relatives
         4. Their love is cold
            1. Only caring for what effects them directly
   3. Their iniquity is that they want their own life
      - Matthew 16:25: 'For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.'
      - มัทธิว 16:25 'เพราะว่าผู้ใดใคร่จะเอาชีวิตของตนรอด ผู้นั้นจะเสียชีวิต แต่ผู้ใดจะเสียชีวิตของตนเพราะเห็นแก่เรา ผู้นั้นจะได้ชีวิตรอด'
        1. When we do life our way, we actully loose the best life God has for us.
        2. When we surrender our life to God, Jesus gives us the best life we can have.
           1. Not about riches, but about being satisfied.
3. Lost people have a cold love already
   1. Their love is for self and what they want
   2. They claim to love others, but really only care about themselves
      1. Causing a large devorce rate all over the world
      2. devorce happens because of selfish desires
         1. Their love is therefore cold, very cold.
4. Is your love cold?
