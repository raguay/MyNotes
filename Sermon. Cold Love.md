Matthew 24:12 "And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold."

มัทธิว 24:12 "ความรักของคนเป็นอันมากจะเยือกเย็นลง เพราะความชั่วช้าจะแผ่ขยายออกไป"

1. Christ is talking about the last days before His return
    1. Verses 4-12 tells of things that will happen before His return
        1. False Christs
            1. over 40 known people to declare that they were Christ since 1800 (2343 BE)
        2. Wars and rumors of wars
            1. for the past 3,400 years
                1. peace for only 268 years
        3. Every nation will hate Christians, great persecutions
        4. famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.
        5. Love of many (Christians) will wax cold
    2. Verses 13-28: What happens when Christ returns
        1. Gospel will be preached everywhere
        2. Anti-Christ will rule (abomination of desolation)
    3. Verses 29-51: What happens after
2. But, the main characteristic of Christians when Christ returns: Cold Love
    1. It's not that they don't love
        1. They love and show love to their family, friends, relatives
        2. They even show true love to their country some
    2. They don't truly love their neighbor
        1. The Samaritan
            1. Saw a need
            2. Knew he could help
            3. Helped the injured as much as he could
        2. This generation of Christians
            1. Don't see the need of everyone around them
                1. Everyone's going to heaven
                2. They have their own way
            2. They aren't willing to help
                1. When they know someone is not saved, they assume someone else will help them
                2. I don't have the time the pastor, missionary, etc. has to witness
                3. It's not my responsibility
            3. They define 'neighbor' as those around them
                1. family, friends, relatives
            4. Their love is cold
                1. Only caring for what effects them directly
3. Is your love cold?
