1 Kings 19:9-16

1. Elijah just had a great battle with the false prophets
	1. There was three years of no rain or dew
		1. God's punishment for worshiping false gods
	2. God had him do a contest
		1. A sacrifice without fire
		2. The God that sent fire was the true God
		3. Only Elijah's god answered
	3. Only God answered Elijah
	4. All the false prophets were slain
	5. God sent rain on the land
	6. Jezebel swore to kill Elijah
2. Elijah ran for his life
	1. Three days on a meal supplied by angels
	2. He wanted to quit
		1. He wasn't any better than his fathers
		2. He was very tired of standing alone for God
3. He made it to a cave on mount Sinai
	1. The same place that God made a covenant with Israel by Moses
	2. God chose there to talk to Elijah about his quitting
4. God speaks to Elijah
	1. A great wind that broke rocks, but God wasn't in it
	2. A fire came, but God wasn't in it
	3. A great earthquake, but God wasn't in it
	4. When he heard a small still voice
		1. Elijah went out to talk to God
5. God like to talk to us
	1. But God doesn't shout, scream, use great signs to talk to us
		1. Those things are for those that don't believe in Him!
			1. Israel in mount Sinai, God appeared in a loud trumpet, and a loud voice
				1. Because many didn't believe in Him
			2. God said "this is my son" in a loud voice
				1. Because no one knew Jesus was God
				2. Still, many said it was thunder and not God
	2. God talks to his servants
		1. When they get quiet and listen for God
		2. He's not going to shake us and make us listen
		3. He wants us to love Him enough to be quiet and listen for Him
