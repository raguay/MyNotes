Matthew 11:1-6

1. John
    1. In prison for preaching the truth (about 6 months to a year)
        1. Herod had married his brother's wife
        2. Forbidden by the Law
        3. John simply told him the Law he claimed to be following.
    2. Not understanding his place in life
        1. If Jesus is God, 
            1. why the rejection and suffering
            2. why doesn't Jesus intervine since he came to rule
            3. If Jesus isn't going to rule now, then are they to wait for another?
        2. John knew he was preparing the people to receive God
    			1. John thought that God came to rule
    			2. No one knew or understood about His rejection, death, and resurrection
    		3. But, He also knew his disciples needed to follow Jesus
            - John 3:30 "He must increase, but I must decrease."
            - ยอห์น 3:30 "พระองค์ต้องทรงยิ่งใหญ่ขึ้น แต่ข้าพเจ้าต้องด้อยลง""
                1. Therefore, he sends them to ask the question
                2. Whatever the answer, they would see that Jesus is the one to follow and not John
2. John's disciples
    1. John was able to have visitors
    2. They were willing to do whatever John said
        1. They knew what John said came from God
    3. John sends his disciples to Jesus with a question
        1. Are you the one? Or, do we wait on another?
3. Jesus' Answer
    1. Straight from Old Testament
        - Isaiah 35:4-6
    2. He basically reafirmed that He was God coming to save.
        1. He did not scold John or put him down
        2. He understood John's confusion because of the persecution
        3. He also knew John was trying to get them to follow Jesus
    3. Blessed is he who is not offended in Jesus
        1. Stays steady and strong, no matter what happens
        2. Not wishy/washy, but has confidence in Him
4. God knows our frame and doesn't scold for bad questions
    1. But, He expects us to wait on his answers or silence
    2. No matter what, to stay faithful to God!
