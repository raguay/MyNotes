Malachi 2:2: "If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart."

Malachi 2:2: "พระเยโฮวาห์จอมโยธาตรัสว่า ถ้าเจ้าไม่ฟัง และถ้าเจ้าไม่จำใส่ไว้ในใจที่จะถวายสง่าราศีแด่นามของเรา เราจะส่งคำแช่งมาเหนือเจ้า และเราจะสาปแช่งผลพระพรซึ่งมาถึงเจ้า เราได้สาปแช่งคำอวยพรของเจ้าแล้วนะ เพราะเจ้ามิได้จำใส่ใจไว้"

    1. Isn't just the receiving of sounds upon our ears
    2. It implies:
        1. Understanding the words
        2. Acting upon the words!
    3. Example:
        1. Yelling "House is on fire" (ไฟไหม้บ้าน)
        2. Everyone runs for safety
        3. Those that heard, understood, and took action
            1. They lived and didn't get hurt
        4. Those the heard but ignored
            1. They were hurt or killed by the fire
            2. They chose not to respond
    4. We are to Hear God in order to give Him Glory
        1. By not hearing, Israel dishonored God
2. God is speaking to His People
    1. If they will not hear
        1. Listen to what He is saying
        2. Act upon it and let it change their lives
    2. They will be cursed
        1. He details His curse being towards money and the things money buys.
        2. He took their pleasures and left barely enough for needs
3. The question is, Are you hearing?
    1. When you study God's Word?
    2. When you hear preaching from God's Word?
    3. When you see others living by God's Word?
