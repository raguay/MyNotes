1 Kings 21:1-10

1. God gave land to the Children of Israel
  1. They could sell it for 7 years
  2. But, it should then return to the original owners because it is the inheritance God gave to the people.
  3. The land given was to stay with the tribe given to forever
2. Ahab, king of northern Israel
  1. He wanted Naboth's vineyard next to his palace
  2. He wanted it for a garden of herbs
    1. It wasn't something he needed
    2. It was simply a desire for something that God didn't want him to have
    3. Naboth knew Ahab want it forever, and therefore refused to sell it to the King
  3. Ahab pouted over not being able to get it
    1. He went to bed and refused to eat
