1. Example
	1. Car failure
		1. Will you call someone far away?
			1. That person loves you
			2. That person knows how to help
				1. But, he is too far away
					1. Others would laugh and say "He can't help"
					2. Therefore, we have no hope in that person helping
		2. We would call someone close by
			1. That person loves you
			2. That person knows how to help
			3. That person is close enough to be able to help
				1. We are near enough to him!
				2. Therefore, we have hope in that person helping

3.How do you pray
	1. As a wish
