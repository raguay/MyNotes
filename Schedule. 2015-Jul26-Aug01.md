1 Chronicles 15:12-13 "And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the place that I have prepared for it. For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order."

### He That Changes Not

Psalms 15:4 "..He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not."
สดุดี 15:4 "...เมื่อให้คำสัตย์ปฏิญาณแล้วต้องพบกับความปวดร้าวเขาก็ไม่กลับคำ"

1. Many times we say something to passify someone
	1. But, we really did not mean it
	2. We just didn't want them to feel bad
2. But, that is a person that "changes"
	1. Their word is not dependable
	2. You never know if they mean it or not
	3. This is disception and is sin
3. God wants us to be true to our word
	1. Even if it hurts others
	2. We can not be something we aren't!
