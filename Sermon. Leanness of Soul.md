Psalm 106:8,12-15

1. Israel's experience
    1. They experienced God's help in a miraculous way
    2. They enjoyed their help and soon forgot God
    3. They then kept asking God for things that didn't matter 
        1. They didn't want what God gave them
        2. They wanted things God knew would not  help them
    4. God gave them what they wanted
        1. But, they got leanness in their soul
        2. A pleague broke out among them
2. Christians experience the same 
    1. We experience God's great salvation
        1. God shows His strength
            1. By forgiving our sins
            2. Enabling us to walk with Him
    2. We enjoy God's salvation, but refuse to listen to Him
        1. Living life for self and not interested in God's plan
    3. We start praying for things that really doesn't matter
        1. Things to satisfy our lust
            - James 4:3: 'Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.'
            - James 4:3 'ท่านขอและไม่ได้รับ เพราะท่านขอผิด หวังได้ไปเพื่อสนองราคะตัณหาของท่าน'
        2. We then have leanness of soul (โรคผอมแห้งมาท่ามกลางจิตใจ)
            1. Thinking we are okay without God's help
            2. We live life just like lost people and never see God's power in our life
            3. When problem happen, we wonder why God doesn't help
3. Are you experiencing leanness of soul?
    1. Repent and follow after God!
