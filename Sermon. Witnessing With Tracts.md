1. Everyone that is born again needs to witness
    1. It's our duty to Christ
    2. He died to save you, why not tell others
2. Use a tract
    1. Most have the complete way to witness
        1. Verses to witness by
    2. People took time to write them
        1. To help others witness
        2. Get the Gospel message out easily
        3. A reminder to us on how to do it
3. How to use a tract
    1. First, read it well
        1. You can't answer someone's questions about it if you don't know what it says.
        2. If you don't read it, why do you think others will?
    2. When talking to others, use the theme of the tract
        1. If you use a different approach
            1. the receiver of the tract will be confused
            2. They will think you don't believe it
    3. Point out the main verses of the tract
        1. They were chosen to help explain the ideal in the tract
        2. You don't have to have your full Bible with you, use the verses in the tract.
    4. If you think of other verses to help explain
        1. Memorize them yourself
        2. Then just tell the person
        3. It will sound more natural and as though you believed it too.
4. Make sure they keep a copy
    1. There for handing out anyway.
    2. Point out the church address, phone, and website on the back.
