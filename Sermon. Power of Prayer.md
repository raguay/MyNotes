James 5:16-18
1 Kings 17:1-6; 18:41-45

1. Elijah (เอลียาห์)
   1. Just an ordinary person like us. - v. James 5:17
      1. He had problems with sin, just like us.
      2. He had doubts about what he should be doing, just like us.
      3. But, he had a heart's desire to walk with God
         1. He was faithful in the small things.
         2. God then used him in mighty things.
   2. God called him to pray for the rain to stop. - v. 1 Kings 17:1-6
      1. It wasn't Elijah's idea.
      2. He was simply following what God told him to do.
   3. God then called him to pray for rain - v. 1 Kings 18:41-45
      1. He told King Ahab that the rain is coming
         1. Before he prayed and saw that it was coming.
         2. He knew that he was doing God's work and God would perform it.
         3. He didn't doubt it because he was walking with God.
            1. We doubt things that we plan because we don't have power ourselves.
      2. He prayed for rain and then sent his servant to see if it was coming. - v. James 5:18
         1. It didn't rain the first time he prayed, but seventh time.
            1. God wants us to keep praying until we see Him working.
            2. All the time believing by faith that God will do it.
2. The Power of Prayer
   1. When we pray according to God's call, God will perform the action
      - 1 Thessalonians 5:24 "Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."
      - 1เธสะโลนิกา 5:24 "พระองค์ผู้ทรงเรียกท่านนั้นสัตย์ซื่อ และพระองค์จะทรงทำให้สำเร็จ"
        1. We just have to follow God's lead
        2. There isn't anything special about us, just God performing His will.
           1. But, we only hear God's calling when we are close to Him.
3. Are we praying in God's will?
   - 1 John 5:14 "And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:"
   - 1ยอห์น 5:14 "และนี่คือความมั่นใจที่เรามีต่อพระองค์ คือถ้าเราทูลขอสิ่งใดตามพระประสงค์ของพระองค์ พระองค์ก็ทรงโปรดฟังเรา"
     1. If we are walking with God and doing what He is calling us to do, then we know He hears us and will perform what He has called us to do.
     2. All old testiment prophets acted according to what God called them to do.
     3. No one in the Bible just did a good work and then asked God to bless it.
