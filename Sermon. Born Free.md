Galatians 4:23 "But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise."

กาลาเทีย 4:23 "บุตรที่เกิดจากหญิงทาสีนั้นก็เกิดตามเนื้อหนัง แต่ส่วนบุตรที่เกิดจากหญิงที่เป็นไทยนั้นเกิดตามพระสัญญา"

1. Abraham had two Sons (Genesis 16 and 21)
   1. Ishmael (อิชมาเอล)
      1. Born of an Egyptian maid to Sarah
         1. Sarah was still barren
         2. They felt they needed to help God
            1. Sarah was just too old to have a child
            2. They couldn't see past human limits
      2. Man's way of working out salvation
         1. Man is always looking for a way to work salvation their way
         2. It is hard for us to accept something by faith
            1. Because, we had nothing to do with it
            2. It is a gift that can't be earned
         3. People like to feel good about themselves and what they do
   2. Isaac
      1. Born of Sarah, Abraham's wife
         1. Despite Sarah's age
         2. God made it happen by His power 
      2. God's promise to Abraham
         1. And of salvation to all who believe
         2. Abraham believed in God's promise
            1. God accounted this as righteousness to him
            2. Abraham was saved by faith in God's promise
2. God accepted Isaac as the heir
   1. Ishmael and his mother were cast out
      1. Man's works can never inherit the promises of God
   2. The two lineages have fought ever since
      1. Muslims are Ishmael's decedents
      2. Jews are Isaac's decedents
      3. Those that trust in self always fight against those that believe by faith alone.
3. God never accepts man's ways
	- John 14:6 "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."
	- ยอห์น 14:6 "พระเยซูตรัสกับเขาว่า "เราเป็นทางนั้น เป็นความจริง และเป็นชีวิต ไม่มีผู้ใดมาถึงพระบิดาได้นอกจากมาทางเรา"
		1. Salvation is only by faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
		2. It never has anything to do with our works
		3. But, true salvation does change what we do
