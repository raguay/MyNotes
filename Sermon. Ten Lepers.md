Luke 17:12-19

1. Ten lepers
    1. leprosy is a type of sin
    2. It is totally incurable
        1. But, Jesus healed many showing he's God
2. As they went to the high priest, they were healed
    1. As they were obeying Jesus, they were healed
        1. Not before
        2. Not after
        3. But, while doing the Lord's will
3. One came back
    1. To praise God and give thanks
    2. He was totally thankful for what God did
        1. It says he was totally healed (made whole)
        2. We need to be more thankful for things God does
    3. The others were more focused on 'doing' than thanking
        - Colossians 3:15 "And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful."
        - โคโลสี 3:15 "และจงให้สันติสุขแห่งพระเจ้าครอบครองอยู่ในใจของท่านทั้งหลาย ในสันติสุขนั้นทรงเรียกท่านทั้งหลายไว้ให้เป็นกายอันเดียวด้วย และท่านทั้งหลายจงขอบพระคุณ"
            1. We need to do what God says AND be thankful
4. Are you thankful for what God has done for you?
    1. Salvation
    2. The health you have, it could always be worse.
