1 Kings 18:41-44

1. Situation
    1. God told Elijah to tell Ahab that there would be three years of draught
        1. No rain
        2. No dew!
    2. Showdown between Elijah and the false prophets of Baal
    3. God promised rain through Elijah
2. Getting the rain to come
    1. Elijah prayed to God
    2. Then asked the servant to look at the sea and tell what he saw
    3. Six times without the expected result
    4. The seventh time showed rain was coming
        1. BTW: seven is the number of completion in the Bible (7 days of creation).
3. Faith in Action
    1. Elijah's faith
        1. Elijah never was discouraged by the results
            1. He didn't quit praying because that was the last thing God told him to do
            2. He knew God promised rain and would deliver
        2. God is faithful to do as He said
            1. He just kept on doing what he needed to do until God changed things.
    2. Saul's lack of faith
        1. He was told to wait seven FULL days for Samuel to come
            - 1 Samuel 10:8 "And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do."
            - 1ซามูเอล 10:8 "และท่านจงลงไปที่กิลกาลก่อนฉัน และดูเถิด ฉันจะลงมาหาท่านเพื่อจะถวายเครื่องเผาบูชา และถวายสัตว์เป็นเครื่องสันติบูชา ท่านจงคอยอยู่ที่นั่นเจ็ดวันจนฉันมาหาท่าน และสำแดงแก่ท่านว่าท่านควรจะกระทำอะไร""
        2. He waited most of it, but before the end of the seventh day
            1. He made and alter and sacrificed to God
                - 1 Samuel 13:8-13
                    1. He took the priest place in God's order of things
            2. Samuel came and rebuked him
            3. Due to his lack of faith - He lost the kingdom
4. Do we demonstrate that kind of faith?
    1. Keep witnessing even when we don't see results
        1. God commanded us to do it
        2. We should do it out of love for God and not for the results
    2. Keep praying even when we don't see answers
        1. God calls us to keep praying just like the widow
            - Luke 18:1-8
        2. God will answer in His time and way
