Malachi 1:6-14

1. Israel's offering to God
	1. It was being offered as a formality v. 7
		1. They didn't really want to
		2. It just what they did if they had time and extra money
	2. They brought the worse of the flock v. 8
		1. They kept the best for themselves v. 14
		2. They just offered, but not with their heart
	3. They perform the duties of God only when it benefits them v. 10
		1. If doing God's service meant they wouldn't be paid, they will not do it.
		2. They have to see real benefit to do it
2. Would you do that to the King or ruler of your people?
	1. If not, why do it to God
	2. God is greater than all kings and rulers of this world
	3. Also, much more powerful! Fear him.
3. How about us today?
	1. Are you worshiping God out of
		1. Custom
		2. Duty to parents
		3. To look good before others, no heart in it.
	2. Are you just giving God your leftovers?
		1. If you have time you'll go to church
		2. If you have extra money, you might give
		3. But, if it cost you money to be faithful to church
			1. You'll make excuses not to go?
	3. God judged Israel for that type of thinking
		1. God will spank His children as well
			- Hebrews 12:7 "If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?"
			- ฮีบรู 12:7 "ถ้าท่านทั้งหลายทนเอาการตีสอน พระเจ้าย่อมทรงปฏิบัติต่อท่านเหมือนท่านเป็นบุตร ด้วยว่ามีบุตรคนใดเล่าที่บิดาไม่ได้ตีสอนเขาบ้าง"
		2. We should willingly Honor and Fear God
			1. Give Him respect always
			2. Realizing His power to "spank" very hard!
