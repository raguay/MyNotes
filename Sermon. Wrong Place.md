2 Samuel 11:1-3

1. The armies of Israel were in the battlefield
    1. The king should be with them
    2. But, David stayed in the castle
    3. He stayed in bed all day 
    4. He saw Bethsheba washing herself
        1. She got the water on the roof during the heat of the day
        2. Once the water was warm and the air cooler, she took her bath
    5. David saw her and desired her
        1. Another man's wife - He had already sinned
        2. The king requests her presence, of course she obeyed
        3. Once she was with child, David kills her husband
        4. One sin leads to more sins, always!
2. Since David wasn't where he should have been
    1. He didn't have God's protection from wrong thoughts
    2. He didn't have God's help to not sin 
    3. He brought destruction to his family
        1. His son committed adultery
        2. Another son kills him
        3. Then tries to kill David and take the kingdom away 
    4. All of that could have been avoided if David was where he was supposed to be.
3. Forsaking God's directions in life always leads to problems
    1. For David, the sword was always with his family 
        1. Joab, David's uncle, betrayed him 
        2. His sons rebelled against him 
        3. Israel was plagued
    2. Those that are where God placed them had all they needed
        1. God used Moses because he was in his place 
        2. God used Joshua because he was in his place 
        3. Elijah was fed because he was in his place 
    3. Those that wasn't had problems
        1. Samson had many problems while God did use him 
            1. He might of lived longer if he stayed where God wanted him
        2. Lot lost his whole family because he chose his own place 
4. Are you where your suppose to be?
