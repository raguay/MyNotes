Luke 14:27-33

1. Count the cost
	1. Whenever we make a decision, we should be thinking about the cost​.
	2. If we can afford it, then do it. Otherwise, it is better not to do it.
		1. The cost can be
			1. financial​
			2. time
			3. our lives
2. Two examples for us
	1. Building a tower - v. 28-30
		1. Figure out the cost of the project
		2. Figure out how much he can pay
		3. If not enough, then don't build it
			1. Otherwise others will make fun of him
	2. King making war - v. 31-32
		1. Figures out how many soldiers he has
		2. How many the enemy has
		3. If he can't win, send to know the conditions for peace.
3. To be a Christian, we must be willing to bear our cross and follow Him - v. 27
    1. Jesus' cross was the work God had for Him
        1. redeeming mankind by dying on the cross
        2. Accepting the shame, pain, etc. of all of the sins of mankind.
    2. Likewise, God has a task for everyone
        1. We have to take His task for our lives and follow Him
            1. Even it it is embarrassing, or hard to do
	            1. Ezekiel laid on his side in public and naked for a 130 days
	            2. Hosea married a whore by God's direction
			2. But, most jobs God gives isn't like that
				1. Moses led the children of Israel to the promise land
				2. Joseph was second in Egypt to save Israel from the famine
					1. Others were saved from death as well
				3. David was called to be King after God's heart
4. Cost of being a disciple and following Jesus - v. 33
    1. Forsaking all
        1. Not abandoning, but putting God before
			1. Self
			2. Family
			3. Friends
			4. Country
    2. To follow Christ
        1. Performing His will with our lives over anything else.
    3. Those are the people that get rewards
        - 1 Corinthians 3:14-15: 'If any man’s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.'
        - 1 Corinthians 3:14-15 "ถ้าการงานของผู้ใดที่ก่อขึ้นทนอยู่ได้ ผู้นั้นก็จะได้ค่าตอบแทน ถ้าการงานของผู้ใดถูกเผาไหม้ไป ผู้นั้นก็จะขาดค่าตอบแทนแต่ตัวเขาเองจะรอด แต่เหมือนดังรอดจากไฟ" 
            1. The works that can abide the fire are those works that God gives us to do and we do it!
            2. The ones that burn up are our own ideas and not God's
5. Cost of not being a disciple
	1. Lost for all eternity in hell
		1. Because no one has kept the 10 commandments for their entire life
			1. Their death proves they are sinners.
			2. A sinner that dies in their sin has no hope of eternal life in heaven.
		2. Lake of fire that never ends
		3. Pain beyond comprehension for eternity
	2. A saved person that quits following Christ
		1. No rewards in heaven
		2. Very embarrassing when you see what others get and you get nothing.
