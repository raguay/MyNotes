Matthew 25:14-30

1. A ruler was going on a trip
    1. Before going on a trip, you need to but people in charge of the kingdom
    2. Everyone had a responsibility according to the rulers understanding of the person's ability
        1. The ruler doesn't give the servant work that they are not capable of doing
        2. He is supplying all the means to perform the job.
2. Three servants
    1. Given five talents (ตะลันต์)
        1. traded on the market with the money
        2. Gained five more
        3. The Lord put him in charge of 5 cities
    2. Given two talents (ตะลันต์)
        1. Traded on the market with the money
        2. Gained two more
        3. The Lord put him in charge of 2 cities
    3. Given one talents (ตะลันต์)
        1. Hid the money
            1. He didn't want to chance to lose the money
            2. Lazy, not willing to work to make more money
        2. Gave one talent back to the lord
        3. Cast him out to utter darkness (Hell)
            1. Unwillingness to serve the master shows a heart that doesn't love
            2. Therefore, most likely still lost and pretending to be a servant
3. We should be like the first two servants
    1. Faithful
    2. Not lazy
    3. Doing what the Lord wants us to do
4. Not like the third
    1. Might not be saved
