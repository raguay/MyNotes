Psalms 80:1-7

1. Northern Israel was having many problems - Ahab was king
    1. Ahab prayed to God and other gods that aren't gods
        1. Since he had a double heart, God sent many judgements
        2. Famine, pestilence, enemies, etc.
    1. God was disiplining them with all kinds of problems
        1. Because they refused to follow God
    1. They were praying for help
        1. But, no help seemed to be coming
        2. The problems were just getting bigger!
    1. The Psalmist understood that Israel was doing wrong
        1. But, they were praying
        2. Why were they still having problems
            1. It seemed like God wasn't listening to them
            2. Or, some thought that God just didn't care
2. Unanswered prayers
    1. As the psalmist prayed - v. 3,7
        1. "Turn us again" - "กลับสู่สภาพดี"
        2. They needed to turn from their ways
            1. But, no one was
            2. The Psalmist is asking God to work in their hearts
    2. The problem with Israel is their prayers
        1. They were praying for help, but they didn't pray in repentance of their deeds
            1. They were still not walking with God
            2. Everyone did as they pleased without thinking about God at all
            3. They prayed for help to use God, but they didn't want to follow God.
    3. Really, God is answering them with more problems due to them not caring for what God wants.
3. Interestingly, praying to use God and not repenting makes God angry
    1. How do you feel when someone asks for help from you and never helps you or does things with you.
        1. After a while, you quit helping them
        2. It's not that you don't like them, you just get tired of being used.
        3. You want a friend, not a user (เพื่อนกิน)
        4. You get angry because they aren't being a friend to you when you need them to be.
    2. God is the same
        1. God wants us to be very close friends with Him
        2. We should walk closely to Him and do His will to be a good friend
        3. Then, when we pray for help
            1. God is pleased to help us too!
            2. It's a mutal relationship and not being a user
4. How are your prayers?
    1. Are you repenting of your sins?
    2. Are you walking with God daily?
    3. Or, are you just asking from God without ever wanting to follow Him?
        1. If so, God is angry with your prayers.
