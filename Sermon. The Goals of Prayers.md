John 14:12-14 "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it."

1. Do the **work** that Jesus did
   1. Jesus preached the Gospel
   2. Jesus helped those with problems
   3. Jesus taught others to do this work
2. **Glorify** the Father!
   1. God created everything and everyone to bring Him Glory
      Isaiah 43:7 "Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him."
      1. If we do something that doesn't glorify God
         - then He did not call us to do it
         - It is our own will
      2. God's purpose for our lives is to glorify Him
   2. When we pray in a way that doesn't glorify God
      1. That prayer will not be answered!
      2. It wasn't a prayer led by God
