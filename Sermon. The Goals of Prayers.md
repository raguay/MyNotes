John 14:12-14 "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it."

1. Do the **work** that Jesus did
   1. Jesus preached the Gospel
   2. Jesus helped those with problems
   3. Jesus taught others to do this work
2. **Glorify** the Father!
   1. God created everything and everyone to bring Him Glory
      - Isaiah 43:7 "Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him. "
      - อิสยาห์ 43:7 "คือทุกคนที่เขาเรียกตามนามของเรา เพราะเราได้สร้างเขาเพื่อสง่าราศีของเรา เราได้ปั้นเขา เออ เราได้สร้างเขาไว้” 
         1. If we do something that doesn't glorify God
            1. then He did not call us to do it
            2. It is our own will
         2. God's purpose for our lives is to glorify Him
   2. When we pray in a way that doesn't glorify God
      1. That prayer will not be answered!
         1. Because it wasn't asked in Jesus' name
            1. If Jesus wouldn't ask for it, neither should we
            2. God only promises to answer prayers that are like Jesus!
         2. Just saying "In Jesus' name" doesn't make it a prayer in His name!
            1. It has to match his character and goals
            2. It never can be selfish or something that glorifies self
      2. It wasn't a prayer led by God
