John 21:25 "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."

ยอห์น 21:25 "มีอีกหลายสิ่งที่พระเยซูได้ทรงกระทำ ถ้าจะเขียนไว้ให้หมดทุกสิ่ง ข้าพเจ้าคาดว่า แม้หมดทั้งโลกก็น่าจะไม่พอไว้หนังสือที่จะเขียนนั้น เอเมน"

1. Jesus' work
	1. He told everyone about God and what He expects
		1. He taught continuously and with authority
		2. He never backed down nor contradicted himself
		3. He also never did anything in secret
			1. He wanted everyone to see and hear what he had to teach
	2. Three years of ministry produced so much results that the world could not contain the books written.
		1. Many believe that it is a hyperbole (อติพจน์)
			1. An exaggeration to make a point
			2. It still means that he did more work than anyone else!
		2. Others think it means that no one would believe one person could do that much, so God limited the amount written.
	3. That means: 
		1. He didn't waste time
		2. He was diligent all the time
		3. He did not labor for self, but to help others
2. Our work
	1. Are we trying to be as diligent as Jesus?
		1. Never waste a moment
		2. Working as hard as we can for God's glory
	2. Can others say that we did more than could be written about us?
		1. Are there things we hide from others?
		2. Are we living and saying the same things before all men?
			1. Not one way at church and another way at work/market
