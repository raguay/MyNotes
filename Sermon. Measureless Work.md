## Measureless Work

John 21:25 "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen."

ยอห์น 21:25 "มีอีกหลายสิ่งที่พระเยซูได้ทรงกระทำ ถ้าจะเขียนไว้ให้หมดทุกสิ่ง ข้าพเจ้าคาดว่า แม้หมดทั้งโลกก็น่าจะไม่พอไว้หนังสือที่จะเขียนนั้น เอเมน"

อติพจน์ - hyperbole

1. Jesus' work
	1. He told everyone about God and what He expects
	2. Three years of ministry produced so much results that the world could not contain the books written.
		1. Many believe that it is a hyperbole
			1. An exageration to make a point
			2. It still means that he did more work than anyone else!
		2. Others think it means that no one would believe one person could do that much, so God limited the amount written.
	3. That means: 
		1. He didn't waste time
		2. He was diligent all the time
		3. He did not labor for self, but for others
