Luke 15:4-10

1. Lost sheep
	1. Shepard has 100 sheep
	2. One goes astray
		1. Sheep often do wander off
	3. The Shepard leaves the 99 to find the one
		1. He searches for it until found
		2. Once found, typically the Shepard would 
			1. break the leg
				1. Not in anger, but in love
			2. then nurse it back to health
			3. The sheep would then never stray away again.
	4. The Shepard then invited all his friends and family to celebrate
		1. That which was lost is found
2. Lost coin
	1. A women is missing one of her betrothal coins
		1. Instead of engagement rings, the husband gave her some coins
		2. If one is lost, it is assumed she was unfaithful
			1. By using the money when she wasn't suppose to
			2. Lost the coin while with another man
	2. She searches for it 
		1. Until she found it
		2. She moved everything and swept everywhere until found
	3. When she found it
		1. She invited all her friends to celebrate with her
			1. She found that which was lost
3. Application
	1. The lost sheep and the lost coin
		1. Many teach that it is a lost person
			1. But, then why were they counted as part of the fold or group
			2. Could be that here God is calling all of mankind to be saved and thus in the fold or group
			3. Or, since it's a parable, just applying the hard searching of the Shepard and women as pertaining to us
		2. But, I think it applies more to Christians gone astray
			1. They were already in the fold of sheep, group of coins
				1. A false Christian that finally gets saved
				2. A child of a Christian family that goes astray and then gets saved
			2. The Lord is looking for them and working in their hearts to repent
			3. They then lost their way
	3. The women and the Shepard
		1. Represent both God and Christians led of God
	4. The celebration
		1. All the angels in heaven rejoice
