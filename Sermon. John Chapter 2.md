1. Marriage in Cana - Water to Wine v. 1-12
	1. The wine is grape juice - nonalcoholic or just a little
		1. There is four types of wine in the Bible
			1. New wine - fresh grape juice
			2. Good wine - grape juice that isn't new but isn't fermenting either
			3. Old wine - grape juice that is just starting to ferment
			4. Hard wine - alcoholic wine
		2. It was considered not as good, but was used to clean dirty water
	2. Yeast/leaven (เชื้อ) is a type of sin
		- Matthew 13:33 "Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
		- มัทธิว 13:33 "พระองค์ยังตรัสคำอุปมาให้เขาฟังอีกข้อหนึ่งว่า "อาณาจักรแห่งสวรรค์เปรียบเหมือนเชื้อ ซึ่งผู้หญิงคนหนึ่งเอามาเจือลงในแป้งสามถัง จนแป้งนั้นฟูขึ้นทั้งหมด""
			1. To make alcoholic wine, you have to add yeast or leaven (เชื้อ)
				1. The leaven eats the sugar
				2. Alcohol is a waste, by product of the leaven
					1. Like eating your own poop!
			2. A little bit of sin corrupts the whole
				- Galatians 5:9: 'A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.'
					1. Paul using it to describe sin in the church
					2. If you allow a little sin in the church
						1. It will fill it up completely with sin over time
					3. We are to remove sin from our lives, not over look it and pretend it's not there
	3. Jesus, being God, doesn’t create or cause sin
		1. Therefore, it is just grape juice being served
		2. Which, after drinking some grape juice, it's hard to notice when it changes.
			1. That is way people usually give less quality grape juice after people have drunk some
			2. It's one way to make an expensive party cheaper
2.  Clearing of the Temple v. 13-22
	1. The Jews turned the Temple into a Market
		1. They sold their sacrifice in their home town and carried the money to Jerusalem to buy the same item and sacrifice to God
		2. More convenient than traveling with it
		3. But, those selling in the temple aways upped the price
	2. Jesus was showing that the market has nothing to do with God
	3. He then said "destroy this temple and he will raise it up in three days"
		1. Meaning the temple of his body
		2. Our bodies are the temple of the Holy Spirit
			- 1 Corinthians 6:19 "What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
			- 1โครินธ์ 6:19 "ร่างกายของคริสเตียนเป็นวิหารของพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์ท่านไม่รู้หรือว่า ร่างกายของท่านเป็นวิหารของพระวิญญาณบริสุทธิ์ ซึ่งสถิตอยู่ในท่าน ซึ่งท่านได้รับจากพระเจ้า ท่านไม่ใช่เจ้าของตัวท่านเอง"
3. Jesus' Knowledge of Human nature v. 23-25
	1. We are corrupted by generations of sin
	2. That corruption makes us Satan's targets to manipulate and use for his schemes
	3. Without the Holy Spirit, we all regress to a sin filled nature
	4. Therefore, Jesus doesn't commit himself to anyone until after they have the Holy Spirit
		1. And then their submission to the Holy Spirit gives us power to walk with Jesus
	5. But, no one at that point had the Holy Spirit in their lives
		1. So, Jesus keeps most of His secrets to himself or in riddles
