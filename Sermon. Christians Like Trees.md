Psalms 92:12-14

1. Palm trees
   1. We might face problems, but we bounce back okay
   2. The harder the trials, the more we resemble Christ and have better fruits of the Spirit.
2. Cedar of Lebanon
   1. Used to be very plentiful
      1. But the things of this world have destroyed most
   2. Mostly pointing straight to God
   3. Grow at high altitudes on mountains
   4. Very Strong
      1. Often used for the mast of ships back then
3. Planted in God's house
   1. God makes Christians to be planted in His house
      1. They will be faithful to church
   2. They will have fruit even in their old age
      1. The will continually perform their Christian duty of pointing others to Christ.
