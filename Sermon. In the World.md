John 1:10-13

1. Jesus and the World
   1. He made the world
      1. Every atom, every inch of the universe was made by Jesus
      2. Nothing exists that wasn't created by Him
   2. He came into the world
      1. He became a man
         1. Just like everyone else
         2. Except: no sin
      2. But, know one knew Him or understood Him
         1. They all believed he was just a man that God was using
      3. Even those that where His own rejected Him
         1. His family didn't believe in Him
            - John 7:5 "For neither did his brethren believe in him."
            - ยอห์น 7:5 "แม้พวกน้องๆของพระองค์ก็มิได้เชื่อในพระองค์"

2. He gives Power
   1. Become the son of God
   2. Live for Him and by Him
