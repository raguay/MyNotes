Proverbs 29:1 "He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy."

สุภาษิต 29:1 "บุคคลที่ถูกตักเตือนบ่อยๆ แต่ยังแข็งคอ ประเดี๋ยวจะถูกทำลาย จึงรักษาไม่ได้"

1. Car Accidents
    1. A drunk driver gets hurt the least in an car accident
        1. His muscles are very relaxed
        2. His whole body just moves with the motion of the car
        3. Lots of scraps, but few major injuries because he is very relaxed
    2. A normal person in a car accident gets very hurt
        1. They try to stop their motion
        2. Their muscle tighten up anticipating the impact
        3. Since their bodies are very rigid, they receive more injuries
    			- bones break
    			- muscles tear
    			- a lot of unrepairable damage happens due to resisting the change in direction
2. When a person is reproved, but he doesn't accept fault
    1. "often reproved" means to be told the same fault over and over
        1. They refuse to believe it applies to them
        2. They feel they are okay doing what they are doing
    2. The constant hearing reproof makes them hardened against the person
        1. no matter what they say, they will not listen to them
        2. They devalue the person and their authority over them
    3. When it comes to true judgement, they are totally destroyed by it
        1. because they are "stiff necked" towards the reproof
            1. The "reproof" is trying to move them in the right direction
            2. The refusal is moving in the opposite direction
        2. They are "stiff" to doing right
            1. the stiffer they become, the more they break!
